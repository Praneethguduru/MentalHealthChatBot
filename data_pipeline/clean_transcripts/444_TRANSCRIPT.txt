Participant: um
Participant: and i had
Participant: um
Participant: i i got pregnant by the man i actually married and still married to
Participant: um
Participant: but we'd only been dating like three months

Participant: um and my friend suggested that we raise the child together
Participant: um even suggested moving to costa rica to raise the child together
Ellie: aw (aw)
Participant: um
Participant: and uh so it was a lot of
Participant: um
Participant: huge decisions

Participant: at times so she comes to me with a lot of um issues
Participant: uh
Participant: she always she always solicits advice from me she thinks i give her good advice
Participant: um and when she doesn't know what to do she'll she'll she'll ask me

Participant: um i'm very enthusiastic about them when i when i start them and i'll get
Participant: almost finished
Participant: and then
Participant: i don't know what happens i just completely lose interest

Participant: where i had to fight for a directorship
Participant: and i realized my limitations where i i couldn't be pregnant and have this child and and do everything i needed to do to get a directorship
Participant: and so i really wish so i resigned
