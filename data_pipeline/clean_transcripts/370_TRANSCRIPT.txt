Participant: i think my dream job would probably be uh you know maybe being able to travel and somehow
Participant: make money off of it profit off it you know make gainful employment off of traveling but
Participant: that's almost an unrealistic dream since i don't know if i would actually wanna do that but if
Participant: if i had to pick some kind of dream existence you know traveling getting paid to travel meeting new people trying new things
Participant: and being able to make a living out of that would be pretty fun
Ellie: travel_changed (what do you enjoy about traveling)
Participant: well i like like i mentioned what i like about l_a i like trying different kinds of food different cuisines so i think trying authentic cuisines in different places and meeting different kinds of people seeing different ways of life uh would be
Participant: eh is what i like about traveling um i i like experiencing new things um
Participant: i think that would be nice you know despite the fact that i said i like the familiarity of l_a there's also
Participant: fun in discovering new things so i i think travel <tr> when i travel that's that's what i like to do just check new things out um
Ellie: yeah3 (yeah)

Participant: so that was pretty fun it was very different it was like really my first time being taken away from my
Participant: my home environment you know i i left in the middle of the school year um so it was just like going from you know suburban america to
Participant: traveling around kind of uh you know taking these old trains and seeing these castles and these old like hundreds of year old towns and
Participant: it i i don't know if um it was for everyone you know i don't know <laughter> if it would be great for everybody but i i really enjoyed it
Ellie: awesome (awesome)
Ellie: relax_fishtank (sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax)
Participant: uh that's that's a good question i do <sigh> uh i probably one of the things i do is either turn on like a rerun of a sitcom um i used to i i watch the office a lot so
Participant: i kinda know when that's on so i'll i'll turn that on you know just uh kind of zone out a little bit to uh you know like
Participant: familiar characters and and hearing jokes that are still funny for some reason or um
Participant: maybe like uh eating some kinda comfort food you know i try not to eat too much fast food at all but uh
Participant: like in n' out i really like going there so if i have to unwind um you know it's once every few months maybe i'll do that
Participant: uh or i really like to read um especially like uh i'll read the day's events you know that that really
Participant: relaxes me for some reason even if it's reading about something some conflict going on somewhere in the world i i still i'll read the headlines and
Participant: i really like to know what's going on that kind of centers me um so i i really enjoy that that's something i do to relax
Ellie: uh_huh (uh huh)
Ellie: control_temper (how are you at controlling your temper)
Participant: i would say <sigh> i'm pretty great at it although i don't i think my nature makes it pretty uh easy <eas> makes that pretty easy i don't <laughter> i don't get very upset <up> upset um easily at all so
Participant: i it's not much of a challenge to control my temper eh um
Participant: yeah i don't <do> i don't really have anger issues i it's it's difficult for me to get angry uh so i don't
Participant: i don't <laughter> i don't really have much trouble with that at all
Ellie: last_argument (when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about)
Participant: the last time i argued with somebody was probably <sigh>
Participant: i don't even know i i i mean small disagreements you know i might've had uh with family or friends about
Participant: things but just a full on argument i i i i can't even remember it's been years i i don't really argue too much i try to avoid conflict
Participant: as much as possible in my my personal life i don't um

Participant: sorry i don't <do> <laughter> i don't have much to say about arguing
Ellie: okay_confirm (okay)
Ellie: feelguilty (what's something you feel guilty about)
Participant: something i feel guilty about i would say that uh you know sometimes <somet> i eh <sigh> sometimes i don't really um
Participant: i feel like i maybe haven't made the most of my potential yet in life i i think that i could definitely do more despite the fact that i work a lot um
Participant: i i feel like i there's always more opportunities uh out there that that we're missing i feel like you know sometimes down time i feel a little bit guilty about that because there's always something that i could be doing that i'm not
Participant: even if it's just putting away the laundry that that's been um i took out of the dryer that's been sitting there or
Participant: running late i really don't like running late um although <sigh> it happens more than i'd like to i'd and i don't know why i feel guilty about that i don't like keeping people wait
Participant: waiting because it makes it feel like uh you know my time is somehow more valuable than theirs which is obviously not true
Ellie: see_mean (i see what you mean)
Ellie: memory_erase (tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory)
Participant: um <sigh> hmm

Participant: was um
Participant: driving in rush hour traffic and you know i i thought the cars in front of me were were going um you know at least for a little you know ten fifteen feet but it turns out they had they had stopped so it was a <deep breath> you know xxx slow
Participant: rear-end collision but it was still very unfortunate i was just uh you know it felt like i was paying attention one second and the next second you know i was just like
Participant: reaching for something on the in the passenger seat and then i i smacked into the car in front of me and <deep breath> uh i i wish that hadn't've happened absolutely uh i know <kn> i know it's a minor thing but
Participant: it was just really unfortunate the timing of it was very bad you know for me financially and the the people i got into an accident with were fine but i was <wa> you know they they
Participant: you know didn't ask for anything beyond repairing the damages but uh it was just uh horrible timing um
Participant: <deep breath> so i i wish that hadn't've happened

Participant: it does suck <laughter> it did suck i'm over it now but eh yeah it it does suck
Ellie: okay_confirm (okay)
Ellie: easy_sleep (how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep)
Participant: well i'm a pretty good sleeper i although i i'm naturally wired to be up later at night so unfortunately my unfortunately my job um allows me affords me a pretty flexible schedule but at on the same token uh
Participant: i wish i could <cou> were like hard-wired to go to sleep earlier because i just i wind up staying up
Participant: 'til one or two every night uh and
Participant: it's just too late you know even though i could get a full eight hours or whatnot of sleep it's not always at night time you know half my sleep is like in the kinda early daylight hours and i i wish i were
Participant: more um
Participant: able to sleep you know go to sleep at like ten or eleven
Ellie: mhm (mhm)

Participant: in my life uh yeah like i said i
Participant: i do regret uh you know maybe not trying harder in my younger days you know i
Participant: there's a period of time in my early twenties where i i didn't work for a while i just uh
Participant: i hung out with a lot of friend you know i guess it was like the proverbial bad crowd you know none of us worked we just uh you know we
Participant: we got high every day um or it seemed like every day i don't know it was just uh eh but it was a it was kinda like a throw-away period in my life
Ellie: advice_back (what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago)
Participant: i would say that um <sigh>
Participant: it's important to
Participant: to to engage with the world i think i i think i kinda dropped out from the world a little bit i think it's also i would say that it's important to um
Participant: recognize the people around you for what they are you know and what <wha> what kinda potential you know future activities they you can expect from from
Participant: the people you surround yourself with i think that uh i would say also that um
Participant: kinda try to focus on what i wanted to do with my life as opposed to just thinking well you know things will work out which
Participant: eventually they do but i i think that you know there's a bit of lost time with that um
Participant: that approach it's kinda fatalistic
Participant: and i i think that i would say you know um just try to concentrate you know you know not <no> not everyone works on the same schedule and life isn't a race but i would say that
Participant: it was it's important to have a goal in mind or some kind of
Participant: you know idea for what what you want out of life as opposed to just kinda waiting and um thinking that things will fall into place
Ellie: mm (mm)
Ellie: makes_sense (that makes sense)
Ellie: feelbadly (tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself)
Participant: um <sigh>
Participant: well i <sigh>
Participant: i i guess when people i i don't especially um
Participant: take even constructive criticism particularly well for some reason i i think that for <f> at least for myself i sort of have things figured out although i i i'm sure i'm wrong about that
Participant: so i think just maybe in terms of like uh group work that i've done professionally or or academically you know when when some of my work is
Participant: uh kinda picked apart or or scrutinized
Participant: i don't <d> i don't deal well with that and i i take it more personally than i should
Ellie: bouts_symptoms (when was the last time that happened)
Participant: uh it was probably about a year and a half ago i was working on a research project at work and uh somebody with much less experience <exp> it was three of us working on something and then they brought it another pair of eyes just to go over it and it was somebody
Participant: just out of uh college you know um
Participant: went over what we had done and
Participant: you know it was just kinda rewording things and it it seemed just like cosmetic changes that were being made just for the sake of of changing things and
Participant: i kinda took personal offense to that just uh because i thought i had a lot more experience and more education and uh
Participant: it it was unnecessary you know i i thought that the whole thing was a waste of time and you know i just um
Participant: i i didn't think that she was somebody that was qualified to to necessarily redo all our work um or or even to uh
Participant: not not to redo it but to to edit it or to uh <sigh> not <no> eh proofread i guess to to make any kind of
Participant: you know qualitative changes i i just thought that it was a a really bad idea and and i i thought that i you know i i shouldn't have viewed it this way but i thought that
Participant: the fact that they brought in somebody with almost no experience you know was kind of like a an affront to us who had worked on it on this project but
Participant: you know it wasn't our call <sigh>
Ellie: yeah_downer (yeah)
Ellie: memorableB (what's one of your most memorable experiences)
Participant: mm most memorable experiences um
Participant: well i guess the <sigh> first thing that comes to mind is one of my um
Participant: the first real trip i took by myself uh i i took the uh the amtrak to to new mexico and i was out there exploring things um
Participant: for about ten days on my own uh so that was kind of the longest
Participant: period of time up 'til that point and i was in my i was i don't know twenty three maybe at the time that i
Participant: i'd really just been on my own completely cut off from everyone i was in parts of new mexico where there was no cell phone reception at the time um
Participant: and it was very memorable because i was on it on my own i felt like i was really uh you know exposed to the things i wouldn't have seen if i had had traveling companions um and it was a lot of fun
Ellie: nice (nice)
Ellie: happy_lasttime (tell me about the last time you felt really happy)
