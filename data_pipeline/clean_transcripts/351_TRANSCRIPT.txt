Participant: gosh um i think probably nineteen ninety seven so a long time ago
Ellie: what got you to seek help
Participant: um
Participant: i'm just uh during that time i was just going through a lot of issues and i was feeling unsafe to myself so i ended up going um to the doctor to kinda get meds and have therapy and stuff
Ellie: do you still go to therapy now
Participant: um not currently i i did about like six months ago
Ellie: why did you stop
Participant: um i just felt the therapist wasn't really helping me um i felt we kept on talking about the same things over and over and
Participant: xxx she wasn't really challenging me and i've been in therapy for a really long time so i just knew it was a change
Ellie: yeah i'm sorry to hear that
Participant: it's okay <laughter>
Ellie: do you feel like therapy is useful
Participant: um yes i do actually um
Participant: when i feel connected to a therapist um and when i feel like it's a really great way for me to talk about what i'm going through um so yes i do
Ellie: what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy
Participant: um
Participant: i'm better at describing my emotions and feelings i think the biggest thing is um
Participant: when i'm in situations eh i can see myself reacting one way and i take a step back and see how i can react normally almost in a way um
Participant: also i tend to take a lot of my emotions and feelings and kind of bury them and make them feel like really bad about myself
Participant: so it's nice to talk to someone that's not judging that doesn't really tell me like you know um they tell me it's o okay basically <clears throat>
Ellie: that's good
Ellie: what were your symptoms
Participant: um
Participant: feeling hopeless all the time
Participant: not having you know enough energy to do things i used to like i had a little bit of concentration issues
Participant: um
Participant: having weird disturbing thoughts sometimes just pop into my mind and just overall just feeling kinda crummy about life
Ellie: are they triggered by something
Participant: um
Participant: sometimes they are at  like random moments that if there's like a problem with like my interpersonal life or something like that or if i sometimes even seeing something on television um like sometimes that affects me
Ellie: how do you cope with them
Participant: um listening to music or trying to distract myself um trying like my therapist told me for the longest time to journal
Participant: to record things
Ellie: mhm
Participant: <clears throat>
Ellie: how have you been feeling lately
Participant: um it's been a tough transition to come here so uh well being <be> being here um so um kinda half and half okay and not okay <laguhter>
Ellie: have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately
Participant: um i feel like i've been a little bit with more withdrawn lately um but that's about it
Ellie: okay
Ellie: how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep
Participant: um <clears throat> some days it's great some days it's not um more recently it's been a little bit more difficult
Ellie: why
Participant: um i don't know why i have like a lot of thoughts on my mind at night <clears throat> so i tend not to sleep very well and i wake up quite frequently during the night <clears throat>
Ellie: what are you like when you don't sleep well
Participant: um <clears throat> very groggy in the morning and um
