Participant: uh i didn't realize that it wasn't there until
Participant: um late i don't know afternoon i think early afternoon and then i called them and
Participant: they said they couldn't send a replacement because it was after ten thirty in the morning which was absurd to me when they made the mistake in the first place
Participant: so i mean for a service that you know we pay for for every day so um yeah it was i was really irratated and then i found out that
Participant: the newspaper had been forwarded to a new address and that had not been communicated with me so

Participant: and she was um explaining to me that there was an additional call that was going to be we have meetings every week classroom meetings and then we also have coaching calls 'cause we have one particular coach we work with
Participant: and then she called to tell me that i was going to have another coaching call with
Participant: um
Participant: someone who's not my coach and uh that
Participant: hadn't been explained to me as part of the program so it in that moment it just seemed to me like oh my god i have all these
Participant: people i have to be accountable to and i'm like eh you know i have to
Participant: not just be accountable to them but share private things that are happening in my life with these people and it just was i don't know
Participant: so
Participant: yeah i wasn't um
Participant: i wasn't angry i was just i just felt frustrated and a little overwhelmed in that moment and
Participant: it you know and i talked it out with her and we got through it but
Participant: um
Participant: yeah i could've
Participant: certainly just um been okay with whatever was being asked of me in the at that time and
Participant: would've made the call go a lot smoother
Ellie: uh_huh (uh huh)
Ellie: hard_decisionB (tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make)
Ellie: hard_decisionB (tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make)
Participant: hmm the hardest decision wow there's been a few
Participant: i guess moving to ireland was probably the hardest decision
Participant: no it wasn't even the hardest decision it was such an easy decision actually but telling my family about it was
Participant: challenging
Participant: um that but the hardest decision was my the first time that i
Participant: moved
Participant: uh away from my family i was twenty eight and i decided to i chose to move to colorado
Participant: and um that was a pretty tough decision 'cause at that point my family had been
Participant: you know within an hour's drive of wherever i lived an hour hour and a half and now they were gonna be you know
Participant: um a twelve hour drive away or a plane ride away so that was it was challenging
Ellie: change_directions (what made you decide to do that)
Ellie: change_directions (what made you decide to do that)
Participant: oh lots of things um
Participant: i loved colorado colorado is a beautiful beautiful state and
Participant: the weather is so much better than wisconsin and um
Participant: at the time i was very much into rock climbing
Participant: and there's just a huge outdoor <outdoo> outdoor community in colorado so there were a lot more people who were
Participant: um in my age group and or single that was another factor um
Participant: and were interested in the things i was interested in so colorado just seemed like a really natural fit
Participant: so
Participant: yeah and then i i found a a job that i liked the pay was atrocious but
Participant: um i found some work that was really rewarding and so it all came together and i chose to move
Ellie: great_situation (that sounds like a great situation)

Participant: yeah
Ellie: easy_sleep (how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep)

Participant: you know then i go to bed late and uh i wake up feeling tired like i feel today
Participant: but generally i can sleep through the night i've had some pretty
Participant: anxiety-ridden dreams the last couple of weeks um
Participant: but even so even when i wake up from those or if i you know stir from those i still can fall back to sleep relatively easily

Participant: out of the <sigh> house that i live in right now where i take care of an elderly woman <sigh> um
Participant: yeah and i just i have to find

Participant: and she creates a lot of anxiety just in her state of being she's exhausting and utterly depressing
Participant: so
Participant: yeah
Ellie: difficult (how hard is that)
Ellie: difficult (how hard is that)
Participant: um living with her is pretty hard like it's probably the hardest thing i've ever done and i would never ever choose to do it again if i honestly if i knew what i was getting into i don't think i would've said yes to the situation
Ellie: isee_downer (i see)
Ellie: feel_lately (how have you been feeling lately)
Ellie: feel_lately (how have you been feeling lately)

Participant: yeah i mean depending on the therapist and depending on your intention like i i don't go into therapy thinking oh i'm gonna be in this therapeutic relationship for the next ten years i think that's ridiculous
Ellie: right2 (right)
Participant: i think you go into therapy to um work on a specific problem and have a solution and have somebody be your sounding board who can see things that you can't see
Participant: and
Participant: you know work through that situation and come up with um
Participant: a strategy for
Participant: not just that not just creating a solution in that area but also just creating strategies
