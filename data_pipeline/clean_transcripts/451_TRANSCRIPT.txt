Participant: um i don't know if i have a dream job anymore
Participant: i'm sixty and
Participant: i don't know if i
Participant: have aspirations anymore towards towards doing anything
Participant: right now i'd just rather not work <laughter> and just
Participant: um
Participant: relax and travel but um
Participant: i i like being creative
Participant: in in any way i can i like independence
Participant: and i kind of have that right now so
Participant: i'm okay
Participant: um
Participant: well i i watch my favorite television shows that i've recorded
Participant: and i also am a buddhist i've been a buddhist for
Participant: um gosh since nineteen eighty eight
Participant: and um i'm
Participant: a district leader in my community
Participant: and we have meetings and that really helps to
Participant: center me and bring out my higher self
Participant: so if i get tense or nervous i i chant
Participant: um sometimes okay sometimes not
Participant: a lot yes yes <laughter>
Participant: less and less though it's been happening less and less
Participant: but um
Participant: yeah sometimes it's got it's
Participant: it's um
Participant: created difficulties
Participant: well
Participant: i can't <c> <sigh>
Participant: i can't remember an argument i remember getting angry like
Participant: was just when i was on my trip in vegas i was driving
Participant: and the g_p_s said stay in the left lane and i stayed in the left lane but when i got off the freeway it brought me onto the ramp that went back onto the freeway
Participant: about four miles out of our way and i just
Participant: i got very angry for about
Participant: thirty seconds and then i had to
Participant: calm myself down and say okay alright so we're gonna be late you know i had to talk myself out of it
Participant: so it wasn't really an argument with anybody but
Participant: i felt kind of
Participant: bad that i overreacted
Participant: um
Participant: you mean in my life <laughter>
Participant: manys
Participant: yes
Participant: um
Participant: gosh there's so many <laughter>
Participant: i i just wish that when somebody tells me disappointing
Participant: information
Participant: like
Participant: they're not gonna use me on a job or something
Participant: that i would
Participant: take an attitude that
Participant: um
Participant: i'll find something better it's okay and
Participant: move on as opposed to feeling what's wrong with me
Participant: and
Participant: you know did i do something wrong and then get angry at them and
Participant: you know that
Participant: whole uh
Participant: thought process that really doesn't help the situation
Participant: and i do that more often
Participant: but i
Participant: since i started chanting
Participant: but it doesn't you know
Participant: i'm not always in my high life condition <laughter> where
Participant: i can do that
Participant: um i find a lot of situations <laughter> hard to make like you know what
Participant: television to buy or something <laughter> but um
Participant: um
Participant: i guess <gue> i guess the hardest decision would be one that had the biggest consequences
Participant: and um
Participant: um
Participant: or leaving my  comfort
Participant: zone <z> place
Participant: if the decision meant that i have to leave my comfort place
Participant: that would be a very difficult decision for me
Participant: and probably leaving a relationship
Participant: very hard because
Participant: you <y> you know i get dependent on that relationship
Participant: so i usually
Participant: live it out til
Participant: it's for you know it's
Participant: they leave or something you know it's very hard for me
Participant: to make that decision that this isn't right and i have to move on
Participant: so what i usually do is i don't make the decision
Participant: and i end up suffering
Participant: but longer
Participant: so
Participant: mhm
Participant: can we move on
Participant: um
Participant: well
Participant: uh it's hard
Participant: because um i don't know if it's because i have pain
Participant: in my back
Participant: and neck
Participant: but
Participant: i i it's difficult for me to
Participant: stay asleep i'd i i
Participant: i don't get a um
Participant: a deep sleep
Participant: um
Participant: but
Participant: at because of
Participant: uh well i so okay it's hard to say because right now i i have this cold and i've had it for two weeks so i've been taking nyquil
Participant: and that's been putting me to sleep so
Participant: i have been um
Participant: sleeping better because of it
Participant: but last night i i woke up coughing so it's it's hard to tell
Participant: but before that all happened
Participant: i was um
Participant: finding it difficult to stay asleep
Participant: and so therefore i'm tired during the day and
Participant: uh sometimes i'm groggy sometimes i'm irritable
Participant: but yeah i'm not really sure if it's related to this pain in my back or
Participant: emotional things or or or or not
Participant: i'm sorry could you repeat that
Participant: have i studied changes in my behavior
Participant: uh no <laughter>
Participant: i was not
Participant: no
Participant: mm mm
Participant: oh i was happy last week <laughter> you know
Participant: well i uh
Participant: was going to um
Participant: vegas to
Participant: meet my family was my
Participant: my family was flying in from cleveland to
Participant: uh there we have a
Participant: a relative in uh vegas
Participant: and i drove with my friend
Participant: and it was my brother in law's seventieth birthday
Participant: so
Participant: we all went and
Participant: had a good time in vegas
Participant: i mean i was struggling through my cold but
Participant: but it was fun it was nice
Participant: well <laughter>
Participant: uh they think i'm funny um
Participant: they feel that i say it like it is
Participant: um
Participant: they understand <under> they all say they understand me <laughter> so
Participant: people who don't understand me i think sometimes don't know how to take me
Participant: 'cause i'll
Participant: i'll say something sometimes come out come across sarcastic
Participant: but just <ju> that's just the way i talk
Participant: so
Participant: um my um
Participant: the
Participant: anger that sometimes wells up in me
Participant: you know i just
Participant: but although that that really made me i think
Participant: a lot of the person that i am you know all all of your
Participant: experiences make you who you are
Participant: and how you handle them
Participant: makes you who you are and if you don't have those
Participant: lows you don't really know what highs are
Participant: so i don't
Participant: i can't really go back and regret you know i wish certain things didn't happen whatever
Participant: but really what matters is today and now and how you handle today
Participant: and i wish that well i can i don't wish i know that i will have less of these
Participant: moments where i've
Participant: just blurt out you know anger or something
Participant: i just wish that would happen more less
Participant: that the anger parts would happen less
Participant: and they are so
Participant: i guess it will <laughter>
Participant: happen less
Participant: um
Participant: don't give up hope live in the moment
Participant: and um
Participant: everything will everything will work out everything will work out
Participant: and if you believe that
Participant: then you really have nothing to fear
Participant: um
Participant: the fact that now
Participant: and for the past twenty years twenty some years i've been
Participant: cultivating myself and i've become <be> i've become
Participant: more um
Participant: compassionate person
Participant: and i'm able to um
Participant: uh
Participant: <ss> understand people better
Participant: and see that you know their suffering <ss> they're suffering too
Participant: and
Participant: that
Participant: if you if you treat people
Participant: from that respect that they're
Participant: they have their problems too and they're suffering with their problems too you're able to live a better life because
Participant: you're not allowing that to affect you you're not taking it personally
Participant: and at the same time you're becoming more compassionate person and when you're more compassionate
Participant: you're you're happy and your life is happy
Participant: okay
