Ellie: memory_erase (tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory)
Participant: <deep breath> hmm <sigh>
Participant: okay um
Participant: so
Participant: this happened
Participant: the the last like
Participant: job that i had i mean i was it wasn't technically i was a freelancer but i was working for this company for like
Participant: a year and a half close to two years and uh
Participant: i had a it very small company the boss <bo> had a really good relationship with my boss um and he sort of <clears throat>
Participant: he sort of out of nowhere
Participant: uh
Participant: mm told me that he was like downsizing basically and um
Participant: essentially like
Participant: the arrangement that we had is that he paid me like a monthly retainer for my services and then on top of that i would get paid fees per project
Participant: so he like sat me down on this conversation and was like you know our major client that is like you know the bread and butter of the company they're the they're really cutting back like you probably notice things are getting really slow and i was like yeah
Participant: and he's like so i'm gonna <onna> i'm gonna <onna> have to stop paying you your retainer
Participant: and this was a total surprise but i was just like okay and he went on to talk about how
Participant: he
Participant: i would still have the right of first refusal of all the projects that came through the door and you know because of that he made it seem like you know
Participant: even though i wouldn't be getting the retainer anymore
Participant: he would throw enough work at me still that like i wouldn't you know it wouldn't be like a dramatic
Participant: decrease in the amount of money that i was making <cough> excuse me
Participant: but um and he was like you know this has nothing to do with the quality of your work i love working with you you're fantastic
Participant: yada yada so
Participant: to make a long story short what ended up happening is he was firing me
Participant: um and he that was his way of basically like phasing me out of the company and letting me go because from that point
Participant: he stopped calling me he stopped emailing me
Participant: and later on like a couple of months down the road
Participant: i um i had to go back into the office because there were a couple projects that were still
Participant: ongoing like the client took a really long time to get back with their notes and when i was in there i saw that um
Participant: this guy who
Participant: had worked with us a bunch kind of like
Participant: if we needed another producer like if we were slammed we would bring him on to do sort of additional stuff
Participant: he was doing my job so
Ellie: oh_no (oh no)
Participant: yeah so it just like
Participant: it was a really <rea> <laughter> it was a really shitty way to be like fired without being told that i was fired um and it was just like
Participant: that uh the reason i would like i if i could i would erase that from my mind is because i can't really think of another situation that made me feel so like angry and frustrated and just like
Participant: in a way that's like
Participant: that still even though this was like you know several months ago feels very unresolved and still makes me kinda like
Participant: angry when i think about it so yeah that was a very long explanation but that's what i wish <laughter>
Ellie: yeah_downer (yeah)
Ellie: im_sorry (i'm sorry)
Ellie: Ellie17Dec2012_07 (what would you say are some of your best qualities)
