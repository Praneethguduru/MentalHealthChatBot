Participant: and i um allow him to express his self
Participant: fortunately unfortunately when i was little um
Participant: there was not a lot of um conversation from parent to child
Participant: um it was more like we were just told you know what to do and we did it
Participant: um and with my son i give him options i allow him to express his self
Participant: i allow him to give me feedback um negative or positive because i feel that it's really important for a child to develop their voice at a young age
Participant: and um as parents you have to be supportive and that and kind of um
Participant: make sure that you nurture that um because that's
Participant: kind of um
