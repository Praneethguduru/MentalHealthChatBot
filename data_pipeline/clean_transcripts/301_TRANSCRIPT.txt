Participant: i can work under my own terms and get paid decently and and be in a creative creative environment
Ellie: mhm
Ellie: how hard is that
Participant: um
Participant: i don't know i think it's just a matter of finding the right situation so right now eh it's been people are a little conservative about what they want so and how they want it so it's a little tougher than it seems <se> it should be but i don't know i think when the situation's right i don't think it's too difficult
Ellie: yeah
Ellie: it can be tough to find a good job these days
Participant: yep
Ellie: what do you do now
Participant: i work as an assistant <as> administrative assistant through a temp agency so
Participant: it's just basically i get sent out to do uh
Ellie: cool
Participant: to do desk jobs
Ellie: are you happy you did that
Participant: um yes and no i mean i feel like i feel like i could do more but you know it works so
Participant: you know yeah
Ellie: okay
Ellie: how close are you to your family
Participant: i'm pretty close i mean they're around so
Ellie: hmm
Ellie: what are some things that make you really mad
Participant: um god really mad
Participant: stupid people just basically doing just doing anything to annoy me
Participant: um
Participant: that's basically <ba> that's the big thing just just irritating stupid people <laughter> who just do things just to provoke provoke me for no reason at all
Ellie: mhm
Ellie: can you give me an example of that
Participant: um what's a good example
Participant: just random people who who think it's funny to just sit there and get a rise out of me just it doesn't have to be one any specific
Participant: situation it's just people who just think it's funny to i think they're just generally sadistic and they just think it's it's funny to to just prod you like it's like poking a stick at an angry dog knowing that they know how to they just wanna push your buttons for no reason so
Ellie: right
Ellie: when was the last time that happened
Participant: uh god
Participant: i don't remember i with those situations i usually try not to remember <laughter> when when it happens i just i just let it go and just like the past is the past i just tend not to look back
Ellie: i understand
Ellie: do you consider yourself an introvert
Participant: what do you mean
Ellie: let's come back to that later
Participant: okay
Ellie: what do you do to relax
Participant: god what do i do to relax i like to run i like to go to the gym
Participant: listen to music i have a lot of musician friends so i just so i'm usually around musicians so
Participant: anything of that sort i like
Participant: i like everything from punk rock art to tattoos to just anything that's that's generally art and creative
Ellie: awesome
Ellie: who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life
Participant: who's been a positive <pos>
Participant: i think it's just friends in general who who seem to who seem to do well and i think they they're very inspiring and
Participant: which is sometimes a a bit tough in in a town like los angeles where i think everybody's on the go trying to accomplish their own goals so they don't
Ellie: mhm
Participant: it's sometimes hard to find someone who's gonna be uplifting or try to be inspiring so
Participant: i don't really have anybody in particular but people have kind of brought up things here and there
Ellie: like what
Participant: you know just like hey instead of instead of doing this how about doing that or hey you're good at this why aren't you doing that or something like that just you know i'm always looking for new opportunities so they always point out things that maybe i might i could do differently
Participant: instead of just being negative saying hey don't do that that's no that's why are you doing that it's a waste of time
Ellie: mmm
Ellie: that's good
Ellie: how are you at controlling your temper
Participant: um i guess it depends on who you talk to
Ellie: <laughter>
Participant: i'm i'm okay at it i could probably work at that
Participant: um
Participant: i don't know i mean i can i i think i can do better at it
Ellie: can you give me an example of that
Participant: well back to the point about people provoking me so i mean i try not to blow steam and let them get under my skin so i just usually try not to let it get to me
Participant: but i don't know i guess with temper i guess it depends on how i handle my stress
Participant: lately i've been better at it just because i think my situation's been a little bit better
Ellie: that's good
Ellie: have you been diagnosed with depression
Participant: no
Ellie: have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d
Participant: no
Ellie: have you ever served in the military
Participant: no
Ellie: okay
Ellie: is there anything you regret
Participant: um
Participant: nothing major
Participant: i mean maybe when i was younger i could've traveled more or i could've worked towards something that paid better job-wise but i mean
Participant: those are all things that i think at any point in life you always think like well i coulda shoulda would've done but you know
Participant: but then again i think that's natural for anybody i mean i could i could've become a banker or i could've become a lawyer or a doctor and made about ten times the money that i make now but
Participant: but then again i don't like the law and i don't like medicine so so i'm it wasn't meant to be so
Ellie: right
Ellie: there are always trade offs in life aren't there
Participant: yeah
Ellie: what made you decide to do that
Participant: so
Participant: um i think
Participant: i think my
Participant: in my life i knew that
Participant: i there's a lot of things i have <ha> there's more dislikes <laughter> than likes so i kinda narrowed it down to what am i good at and what am i not good at and what am i gonna work well or who who am i gonna work well with and who will i not work well with
Participant: so i kind of i kinda sorted out and then the list kind of
Participant: mmm kind of answered itself so
Ellie: that sounds really hard
Participant: no it i don't think it was hard but it was just but i think it was a real reality check and i think it it's kind of a good thing 'cause sometimes trying to conform to doing things that doesn't really fit you doesn't make sense
Participant: it's like trying to shove a a round peg into a square a square hole and it's like it just no matter how you try to shove it in it's not gonna go in so sometimes it's just might as well go down a path that seems to work better for you
Ellie: right
Ellie: that makes sense
Ellie: what's one of your most memorable experiences
Participant: memorable experiences um hmm
Participant: i think it's just i don't really have like any one in particular i think i think every day is almost like a memorable experience whether it's positive or negative i think it's just everything from getting it just just the fact that
Participant: i got a job and i can i can take care of myself is already almost like a memorable experience maybe for the average person it it sounds stupid but you know i think just the fact that i'm able
Participant: i'm able to get this far in life without like completely self-destructing is already an accomplishment so i feel like
Participant: i've gotten somewhere
Ellie: that's great
Participant: maybe not to not maybe not to the point to the average person they might think like well why aren't you a millionaire but you know what not everybody can be a millionaire
Ellie: yeah
Ellie: i see what you mean
Participant: yeah
Ellie: when was the last time you felt really happy
Participant: um
Participant: when was the last time i really felt happy
Participant: um
Participant: i don't know i'm not really someone who's like
Participant: i don't have any real high highs or low lows i mean i haven't hit any lows so i mean i
Participant: i don't know i'm usually pretty i feel like i'm a level person and i'm pretty happy <ha> every day i feel like if i accomplish one thing then i'm pretty happy so
Participant: i guess to answer the question probably
Participant: mmm probably yesterday i just feel like if i if i'm able to accomplish something then then hey i'm happy
Ellie: that's great
Ellie: how would your best friend describe you
Participant: i don't know i don't really have a best friend but i mean i well to answer the question generally friends
Participant: i think they would say that i'm very <ver> pretty outgoing i'm pretty
Participant: determined
Participant: i'm trying you know i try to you know i try to interact as much as possible i'm always out networking as much as possible
Participant: so
Participant: i don't know i guess that's basically what i think they would describe me as
Ellie: okay
Ellie: okay i think i've asked everything i need to
Participant: okay
Ellie: thanks for sharing your thoughts with me
Participant: no problem
Ellie: goodbye
Participant: alright
Participant: bye
