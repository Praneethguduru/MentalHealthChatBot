Participant: uh <sigh> i'd say uh for the last couple of weeks uh
Participant: i noticed that i go through certain situations like you was talking about the anger situation it's like i don't get angry all the time that's not me so sometimes when i get angry i have to find out what's causing all this what's what's causing me to get angry
Ellie: mhm
Ellie: yeah
Participant: and i have to take
Ellie: how hard is that
Participant: excuse me ma'am
Ellie: how hard is that
Participant: uh it's not hard at all 'cause alls you have to do is just take your time and reflect about everything uh that you have gone through and uh take a good look at the situation and uh
Participant: and then go from there and find out what's what's really bothering you
Ellie: okay
Ellie: how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep
Participant: it's very seldom
Participant: uh i suffer from p_t_s_d and uh getting that type of sleep
Participant: would be would be great
Participant: because i have recurring nightmares so of a incident so
Ellie: are they triggered by something
Participant: <sigh>
Participant: i i think it is and i don't know what it's triggered by but i think it is and that's why i'm talking to someone or seeing someone 'cause i'm a veteran
Participant: at the uh v_a about the situation now
Participant: about the p_t_s_d basically right now
Ellie: yeah
Ellie: what got you to seek help
Participant: excuse me ma'am

Participant: uh <sigh> a lot of nightmares lot of problems lot of anger issues uh depression
Participant: uh i noticed all this in me and uh
Participant: i started i just started to just tell myself i needed help
Ellie: mhm
Participant: and that's that's basically it i just you know i just you know i just something wasn't wrong with it something wasn't right with me
Ellie: is going to a therapist helping you
Participant: and when something's not right with me i have to take time out to just you know take a good look at myself and ask myself if something's right then you if something's right then that's fine if something's not right then you need to take care of it
Ellie: yeah
Participant: and uh i just started seeking help down there yeah
Ellie: i understand
Ellie: is going to a therapist helping you
Participant: somewhat yes it is somewhat

Participant: well i'm able to sit down and talk to the therapist and uh tell 'em my situation and we usually will go over the problem
Participant: and uh
Participant: i went to classes i've been to uh uh talking one-on-one with my own doctor so it's helping out a little bit
Ellie: that's good

Ellie: okay
Ellie: how would your best friend describe you
Participant: my best friend
Ellie: mhm
Participant: uh they he would describe me as a fun loving good person always there that try to help others uh
Participant: think more of others really than more of myself but when i know i need things need to be done for me i take care of it
Participant: so you know and they really actually they really look up to me they have a lot more respect for me
Ellie: mhm
Participant: yeah they see something in me they wish that they had
Ellie: do you consider yourself an introvert
Participant: excuse me ma'am
Ellie: do you consider yourself an introvert

Participant: uh books crossword puzzles
Participant: uh walking
Participant: that's about it
Ellie: okay
Ellie: is there anything you regret
Participant: i thought i did but i don't think i do i don't think i regret anything because
Participant: this is this is how it is this is the way it is for me so i accept it and i keep moving on
Participant: because if i regret anything in the past then i'm wasting my time on that because it's gone that's the past i need to move on i need to live in the present so i can be prepared for the future so i can move on to the future
Ellie: yeah
Ellie: mhm i see what you mean
Participant: yeah
Ellie: what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago
Participant: <sharp inhale>
Participant: uh <sigh> more education uh
Participant: being more direct and more confidence in what i'm doing
Participant: like i am today so yeah that's what i was lacking maybe twenty years ago
Ellie: okay
Ellie: who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life
Participant: uh yes <ye> yes i have had a lot of positive people been been in my life
Ellie: can you give me an example of that
Participant: uh <sigh>
Participant: yeah some people would uh uh uh well consistently <cons> xxx i mean consistently motivate me
Participant: to continue and to pursue a certain goal and uh i thought that was pretty good because i really don't see that a lot
Participant: and uh
Participant: he gave me a lot of motivation to try to go up and try to do certain things 'cause anything that you do it's a choice it's up to you whether or not if you do it or not that choice is still up to you for it to be done
Ellie: yeah
Ellie: what are you most proud of in your life
Participant: excuse me ma'am
Ellie: what are you most proud of in your life
Participant: uh <sigh>
Participant: that i'm able to really be able to be self-motivated
Participant: and really be able to put my best foot forward and be able to get a lot of things accomplished which i thought i couldn't but it can be accomplished
Participant: if i'm willing enough to put the will to it to do it
Ellie: mhm
Ellie: that's great
Ellie: tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed
Participant: oh wow huh
Participant: oh really and you know what i really enjoyed
Participant: was sitting down with my social worker and we're talking about getting things done within my life
Participant: and school was one of 'em uh
Participant: and just being just school was one of 'em and i kinda liked it that because that was the first time someone was willing to really sit down with me and work with me
Ellie: mhm
Participant: yeah and i thought that was a great thing so as long as you're willing to do that i'm willing to go even the extra mile and even be motivated to do other things besides school
Participant: and uh yeah that and that and that's what gets me going
Ellie: yeah
Ellie: that sounds like a great situation
Participant: oh it is and i love it and uh this is going to be accomplished
Ellie: okay i think i've asked everything i need to
Ellie: thanks for sharing your thoughts with me
Participant: thank you
Ellie: goodbye
Participant: goodbye
