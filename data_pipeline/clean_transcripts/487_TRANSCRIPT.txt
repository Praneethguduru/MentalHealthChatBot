Ellie: situation_handled (tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently)
Participant: uh
Participant: some of the instances when i might've been with him and i
Participant: you know got emotional or
Participant: let it bother me that he made such a big deal of something rather than
Participant: um
Participant: just you know seen it as
Participant: not something to respond to perhaps but it would always be we're we were also pushed to answer so
Participant: you know you can't always just say ignore a person there 'cause many times it's just a matter of ignoring situation and it doesn't escalate
Participant: but some people
Participant: you know don't respond to the so-called norm
Participant: if you ignore it
Participant: mm uh they'll just you know de-escalate but that's not always the case
Participant: i taught middle school kids and you can try calm
Ellie: yeah_downer (yeah)
Participant: um methods with them but that doesn't always work but you always have to as the teacher maintain

Ellie: see_mean (i see what you mean)
Ellie: hard_decisionB (tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make)

Participant: uh
Participant: that you know the outcome was uncertain it could go either way

Ellie: memory_erase (tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory)
Participant: <sigh> oh many different things that could occur you know in life you always are second guessing
Participant: things that you might could do but
Participant: they also can be learning experiences so is it necessarily a good thing to
Participant: erase them you know if
Participant: you can look at it as positive sometimes people can have a
Participant: strong reaction and they don't really look past the
Participant: uh impact of the event
Participant: 'cause there might be something that
Ellie: mm (mm)
Participant: you can gain from that
Ellie: yeah3 (yeah)
Participant: but there are i i grew up in a home of
Participant: dysfunction so there was
Participant: just domestic abuse you know and um
Participant: there were many incidences so you can't just say only one 'cause there is lots of traumatic things
Participant: but it also would've been a different outcome in say learning to deal with some of the things
Participant: that occur in life as an adult that
Participant: sometimes i see among acquaintances or friends that
Participant: have not had really strong experiences
Participant: fall apart or just have very very difficult times dealing with so
Ellie: right2 (right)
Ellie: symptoms_cope (how do you cope with them)
Participant: um you can listen you know you and i and i 'cause i understand that not everybody's had the same experience you know you can
Participant: walk them through
Participant: levels of
Participant: understanding and you know
Participant: as you know someone
Participant: you have a balance of background information on
Participant: which to help them pull from and to see that you know things will
Participant: progress in a better way knowing that this isn't like
Participant: the end of the world or as terrible as it seems that it could be
Participant: and you can also relate other experiences to them
Participant: of things that were worse or
Participant: you know seem to be
Participant: and of course there's always in general i mean
Participant: when you look at all the calamities in the world
Participant: you know most of those things aren't affecting
Participant: us or the people that we know here
Ellie: mhm (mhm)
Participant: so that provides
Participant: us perspective that
Participant: you know can pull someone out of their
Participant: i won't necessarily say self-absorption but the seemingly
Participant: intensity of their experience right at the moment
Ellie: yeah_downer (yeah)
Ellie: family_relationship (tell me about your relationship with your family)
Participant: well we have a a good relationship they
Participant: eh for the most part there are different levels of
Participant: um stress and trauma that some of my siblings have experienced so it has
Participant: made them interact with life and people you know more intensely than others
Participant: some have not had um
Participant: as much
Participant: experience in life that will help them deal with things you know in a different way
Participant: so it's always evolving
Participant: and i
Participant: walk in positivity as a a lead of
Participant: you know uh the way i respond to uh try and engender
Participant: a more positive
Participant: response from them
Participant: rather than feed
Participant: sometimes the
Participant: um very strong reactions or responses or interactions that they may have

Participant: positive <po> positive and proactive
Participant: and have you know taught independent thinking and
Participant: techniques to rise above some of the things that
