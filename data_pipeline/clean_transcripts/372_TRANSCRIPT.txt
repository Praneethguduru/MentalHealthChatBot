Participant: more than most people do i think
Ellie: last_argument (when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about)
Participant: hmm
Participant: last night
Participant: <laughter> but it was on the telephone i was arguing with my husband
Participant: um we have my sister lives with us
Participant: and she lives with us in a very small room with
Participant: a small apartment i should say
Participant: and she's got four people living in in one room so um
Participant: it's kind of stressful it's really crowded
Participant: and my husband is stressed out about it
Participant: and
Participant: you know i'm just saying to him that
Participant: i told you so i told you if my sister moved in here
Participant: then there was gonna be a mess in the house and she's gonna be asking for things you don't really wanna do
Participant: that's just how my sister is <laughter> so the house is messy and it's crowded
Participant: and every day they're asking for rides and my husband
Participant: he's
Participant: avoiding coming home because all these people are home and he doesn't wanna be there anymore
Participant: and i'm just saying that
Participant: he's gonna have to find a way to deal with it because
Participant: he asked for it in my opinion <laughter> so <laughter>
Participant: hmm
Ellie: that_sucks (that sucks)
Participant: it does <laughter>
Ellie: situation_handled (tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently)
Participant: oh
Participant: i've got tons of 'em but right now
Participant: what's on my mind is um losing custody of my son
Participant: um
Participant: right now like
Participant: i've been arguing with my stepmom
Participant: and
Participant: my stepsister for a long time about
Participant: my son and how they treat him and how i want him to be treated
Participant: like they don't have any boundaries
Participant: and i believe that boundaries are important establishing who's the adult who's the child
Participant: they let my child boss 'em around and stuff
Participant: anyways because of this
Participant: they're gonna be testifying against me in the custody trial saying that
Ellie: oh_no (oh no)
Participant: yeah they're gonna be saying that i'm not a good mom
Participant: because i believe in having boundaries and we have very different
Participant: ideas about child raising
Participant: she's my stepmom she's my dad's fifth wife
Participant: and
Participant: she's
Participant: she really doesn't she's really far removed from
Participant: how i was raised and i wanna raise my child
Participant: more similar to how i was raised where you're we had some independence and we had some boundaries and we knew what the rules were and what was expected of us
Participant: and
Participant: with my stepmom she xxx no rules she has no expectation she just wants him to run wild
Participant: and have everything that he wants
Participant: and that's fine when you're a grandparent but the problem is that i live with them sometimes
Participant: and when i'm in the same house with them they should be following my rules
Participant: and not
Participant: trying to go and break all of my rules
Participant: <sigh> anyway <laughter>
Ellie: right2 (right)
Ellie: makes_sense (that makes sense)
Participant: yeah
Ellie: describe_felt (how did you feel in that moment)
Participant: um in that moment <sigh>
Participant: just really frustrated because they don't listen to me
Participant: i feel
Participant: disrespected i feel
Participant: like invisible
Participant: i feel
Participant: just angry
Participant: that
Participant: they're taking away my right to parent and it's something that i worked really hard to do
Participant: i went to school and i studied child development
Participant: i've read all the magazines and i've read the books and i'm really <laughter>
Participant: i know what i'm talking about i feel confident in my parenting skills and my parenting abilities
Participant: and
Participant: to have these people that haven't done the same thing and worked as hard as i have to be a good parent
Participant: try and tell me that i'm a bad parent
Participant: it's really
Participant: uh
Participant: hard to believe so i feel very disrespected
Participant: um
Participant: unacknowledged angry frustrated
Participant: all those things <laughter>
Ellie: yeah_downer (yeah)
Ellie: im_sorry (i'm sorry)
Ellie: easy_sleep (how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep)

Participant: but i am a good mom and i feel confident that i'm a good mom
Participant: i just
Participant: i don't really have the money to take care of my son like my dad the son's dad does he has more money than me
Participant: and right now i'm trying to be okay with it because
Participant: i know he can do more for him
