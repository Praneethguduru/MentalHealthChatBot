Ellie: wow
Participant: mhm
Ellie: what do you think of today's kids
Participant: oh mostly very talented
Participant: <ss> um just um more involved in technology than maybe i was
Participant: or am and they're um
Participant: i think they're more of a hive mind than when i grew up
Participant: just seems like they were all hooked into social media
Ellie: yeah
Ellie: i understand
Ellie: what do you do to relax
Participant: uh go on a walk or
Participant: watch television
Ellie: mhm
Participant: or play with my computer
Participant: and uh
Ellie: what are some things that make you really mad
Participant: um well
Participant: there's some <so> some
Participant: uh
Participant: there's some kind of uh
Participant: injustices that happen in not
Participant: not <n> not big deals but for example our parking situation got worse with some new district parking
Participant: eh that's kind of upsetting and the city doesn't seem to wanna
Ellie: oh
Participant: uh make any exceptions or change some rules
Participant: and also uh some unfair things at work sometimes happen that are upsetting <ups>
Participant: uh that are upsetting
Ellie: can you give me an example of that
Participant: uh yeah
Participant: i worked for <f> in school <sch> uh uh at a high school <sch> i worked at a high school dance uh this last weekend and when we arrived at the site
Participant: the people at the site said we couldn't set up all of our equipment and backdrops and things at the location where we were assigned to do it that we had to go outside
Participant: and then to get an okay to go inside because being outside we weren't prepared for nor <no> nor told in advance that we were to be outside
Participant: um it delayed our setup time and that doesn't <does> wouldn't have bothered me except that on monday morning um the school called <call> called our boss and complained
Participant: that we were late setting up when it when they told us
Participant: to wait for them and we told them we would be delayed if we wait and did we still get a complaint so that that part is upsetting and
Participant: and our work doesn't back us up the at the office they just need to please the school to maintain the account so
Participant: uh often when that something like that happens it means they will not send you out to work at that school again which to would translate into less payroll hours for the the photographers that were on that job
Ellie: oh no
Participant: that's yeah that's how they do things
Participant: so that that is upsetting
Ellie: how do you cope with them
Participant: uh most of the time that will i i dust off my resume <laughter> and start looking for other situations that are
Participant: that might be better
Participant: um
Ellie: that's good
Participant: yeah
Ellie: how are you at controlling your temper
Participant: uh pretty good <sigh> i i i usually xxx
Participant: might uh i in the moment i don't really lose it but xxx later i might um vent or something like that
Participant: but on the spot <sp> on the location i wouldn't do that
Ellie: mhm
Ellie: when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
Participant: um
Participant: well just today um we have a uh schedule <sc> tight schedule today and i have a friend that i'm car <c> sharing a car with today and uh we
Participant: we were arguing where to go first
Participant: and um so we compromised and
Participant: did most of her things and one of my things then after
Participant: this <th> this was one of the things is over then we're gonna do some more of her things so
Participant: but it
Ellie: that's good
Participant: yeah
Ellie: have you ever served in the military
Participant: no
Ellie: have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d
Participant: post-traumatic stress syndrome is that what that is
Ellie: mhm
Participant: uh
Participant: no i have not
Ellie: have you been diagnosed with depression
Participant: yes
Ellie: how long ago were you diagnosed
Participant: oh <sigh> i'd say nineteen eighty
Participant: yeah i think believe it was nineteen eighty
Ellie: that's a long time
Participant: yeah
Ellie: what got you to seek help
Participant: um
Participant: well my father noticed some symptoms my father is just well he's passed away but he was a psychiatrist
Ellie: what were your symptoms
Participant: um
Participant: well i wasn't sleeping i was laying around the house
Participant: um i was waking up at
Participant: noon <laughter> something like and i didn't have a um
Participant: focus like for getting a job it wasn't clear enough
Participant: uh i i remember some job interviews that i'd go to their front door and then i wouldn't go in <laughter> and i think that was all all part of depression
Ellie: yeah
Ellie: did you think you had a problem before you found out
Participant: yeah i thought i had a problem but i didn't know what it was
Ellie: do you still go to therapy now
Participant: no
Ellie: why did you stop
Participant: uh well
Participant: eh i went for three years and then the psychiatrist said that
Participant: he thought that i was done <laughter> but uh
Participant: and i and i i did get to a much better place i have to watch all the time to see what's going on
Participant: with depression so i think i i'll have good days and bad days
Ellie: what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy
Participant: um
Participant: i think therapy makes you see what the um
Participant: like the i i thought of it as a filter or wearing a pair <pa> as if you were put on a depression pair of sunglasses you don't really
Participant: you see everything through that so you have to kinda <k> i have to sort of
Participant: try to take the those glasses off for a little bit and double check am i really perceiving these things accurately
Participant: or am i seeing it through a depressed viewpoint
Participant: and i try to look for clues about that
Ellie: that makes sense
Ellie: mhm
Ellie: how have you been feeling lately
Participant: i think i'm um
Participant: slipping back a little bit uh uh i don't do well during unemployed periods
Participant: i've noticed in my path in my past and um right now we have a work slow down so it's easy to slip back into sleeping too late or putting things off because the schedule's too wide open for
Participant: for me for me personally as a depressed person i think that structure is really important
Participant: it um
Ellie: yeah
Participant: it gets you out of bed and you have to get somewhere in time and
Participant: deal interact with people is all those are all beneficial things for someone who's tends to be depressed
Ellie: uh huh
Ellie: have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately
Participant: uh
Participant: well i don't know if it's changes as i a little bit i just tend to be focused on some things that are
Participant: probably not that um uplifting let's say uh but it's more negative like i
Participant: have <ha> have been sort of thinking about how um
Participant: um
Participant: soldiers in the past uh i don't know why but like the in during the roman era <er> era or the greeks <gree> ancient greeks how it would've been like to be in a in a frontline battle with
Participant: mm
Participant: you know just crude <cru> kind of crude <cru> in my opinion crude weapons and no medical help and
Participant: the i don't know i seem <se> my mind seems to go there a lot where i'm just thinking about that and i've been looking <look> looking at it and reading books about that or um video clips on youtube and
Ellie: yeah
Participant: eh things like that or um
Participant: some other things <thi> other uh kinda like terrible doom type themes like i was watching on the animal show like crocodile attacks and things like that
Participant: where probably shouldn't dwell so much on that
Ellie: okay
Ellie: yeah
Ellie: is there anything you regret
Participant: oh you mean in life in general yeah well
Participant: i think i regret not finishing college i think i had a i think i was <wa>
Participant: uh was going into depression right then and wasn't coping in my senior year very well
Participant: and um didn't really
Participant: i didn't get out of college with a degree although i was there seven years but uh so that's very that's a big regret that i have
Ellie: hmm
Ellie: what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago
Participant: um
Participant: i think it would've been to um
Participant: at certain points i probably should've sought <so> um sought therapy and also probably some
Participant: uh outside help just with um getting through finals just the logistics
Participant: i had i was an art major and i had no car so
Participant: a a lot of the art projects and things were difficult to move back and forth and
Participant: and also to uh meet at away locations i think it probably would've been worth it to
Participant: do whatever it took to get a car <laughter> at that time
Ellie: uh huh
Participant: so
Ellie: i see what you mean
Ellie: what would you say are some of your best qualities
Participant: um
Participant: well i'm i've been told i'm very patient
Participant: and also i have um some original original artistic ideas
Participant: so
Participant: um those are
Participant: those are good qualities i'm very loyal and and also um
Participant: you know i support my friends i'm fairly generous with them
