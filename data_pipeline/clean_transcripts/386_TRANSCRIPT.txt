Ellie: oh_no (oh no)
Participant: yeah and i need eight hours of sleep and i've only been getting
Participant: ooh i'd say like maybe six hours and then i usually wake up once at night too 'cause sometimes they'll
Participant: kind of around two or three in the morning they'll either walk around or i'll hear something so
Participant: i'm not getting a straight eight hours of sleep and it's definitely <laughter>
Participant: but there's not like i said there's things you can't control when you live in an apartment you know i mean the the lady's uh very quiet it's just that she has a habit of
Participant: you know
Participant: taking later showers <laughter> washing clothes at night that's
Participant: i can't say anything to her about that
Ellie: that_sucks (that sucks)
Participant: so
Participant: yeah but you know there's people that are in worse situations so i don't make a lot out of it you know and i just it's not like every night but it's you know

Participant: for now you know that's i'll deal with it so
Ellie: sleep_affects (what are you like when you don't sleep well)
Participant: tired <laughter> very tired and hard to focus hard to concentrate it just takes me longer to get things done 'cause i don't have my energy also i haven't been exercising i normally try to walk about half an hour a day but
Participant: the weather's been kinda colder and kinda drearier so
Participant: you know i'm not as motivated when the weather's kinda blah so it's a combination of both not getting my exercise and not getting eight hours sleep
Ellie: uh_huh (uh huh)
Participant: mhm
Ellie: feel_lately (how have you been feeling lately)
Participant: uh as i said before um tired <laughter> i'm
Participant: i it's a combination of the weather you know and here in los angeles right now we're have been having very grey days i live very close to the ocean
Participant: so the sun doesn't come out that much so i'm not getting my serotonin <laughter> i need that
Ellie: right2 (right)
Participant: i um
Participant: i'm not getting my eight hours of sleep because you know
Participant: whatever and i think my thyroid is acting up too so that's kind of
Participant: creating you know i have some vitamin deficiencies
