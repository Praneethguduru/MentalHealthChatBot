Ellie: awesome
Ellie: what's your dream job
Participant: oh my dream job is to be a filmmaker that's what i wanna do i wanna die doing that job making movies
Ellie: how did you decide to do that
Participant: well when i was uh in high school i did a lot of drama theater productions and i just love everything about film so once i had the opportunity to actually make a film uh because i wasn't getting any work as an actor i just got hooked i just love making film
Ellie: that's great
Participant: <laughter>
Ellie: when was the last time that happened
Participant: last time i made a film just this last october made a short film
Ellie: what was it about
Participant: <laughter> it's about three people that connect together they're completely unrelated but they get to a retreat where they realize that their problems are bigger than what they imagined originally
Ellie: mhm
Ellie: that sounds interesting
Participant: thanks <laughter>
Ellie: what are some things that make you really mad
Participant: really mad uh
Participant: <laughter> really mad i
Participant: you know i guess what makes me really mad is when my daughter acts stupid at school when she does not do her work and uh when she doesn't pay attention and i have to get phone calls home and letters home and emergency parent conferences that's what makes me mad
Ellie: uh oh
Participant: yeah
Ellie: that sucks
Participant: <laughter> yeah yeah it sucks she's one of the smartest kids in her school
Ellie: do you find it easy to be a parent
Participant: no it's it's it's very difficult because a lot of things in yourself that
Participant: you find are negative go to them and it's like you're fighting against yourself trying to change yourself but you know that little person is you
Participant: you know times a hundred and it's just difficult to deal with that but um
Participant: other than that it it's okay but it's being a parent is never easy
Ellie: yeah
Ellie: what's the hardest thing about being a parent
Participant: <sigh>
Participant: the hardest thing about being a parent
Participant: i would say is
Participant: trying to give
Participant: that little person so much life experience so that they don't make mistakes or so that they don't get hurt and you wanna give it to them and you want them to just accept it right away but then they don't so
Participant: it gets very uh
Participant: um
Participant: annoying sometimes that you know what's coming and you give them the info and they don't wanna take it they wanna find their own way and to watch them get hurt
Participant: it's it's sad and then they wanna come to you and you're like ugh i tried to tell you but you can't be mad at them because everybody learns their own way so
Ellie: uh huh
Ellie: that sounds really hard
Participant: mm
Participant: yeah i guess for a while when when you think about it uh when you watch them go through their struggles it's hard to watch
Participant: but it's a necessary motion of life children have to learn the way they wanna learn 'cause once they get it they got it so however they get it
Participant: you as a parent you're happy they got it
Ellie: that's good
Ellie: what's the best thing about being a parent
Participant: <sigh> all the love the children bestow upon you it's great they
Ellie: aw
Participant: yeah they love <lo> you know love you and all especially my daughter she always wants to give me hugs
Participant: she always wants to talk to me she always wants to be around me uh she always tells me i'm doing a great job when i'm like <laughter> what does she know about a great job she's only seven but
Ellie: <laughter>
Participant: you know they have that unconditional love and you just can't help but feel like a good person for
Participant: having the children tell you that you're a good person so
Participant: i like that
Ellie: yeah
Ellie: that's so good to hear
Participant: hmm
Ellie: what do you think of today's kids
Participant: oh <laughter> my god they're
Participant: ooh <sigh> they're you know it like albert einstein said it best that our technology has exceeded our humanity
Participant: and there's so much technology out there kids are learning so fast it's almost like they're already little adults but
Participant: they're missing the steps to being a child they miss going outside they miss learning about things naturally rather than just going to youtube or
Participant: you know wherever facebook and and getting it so fast and they don't know what to do with all this information
Participant: and they just have to fight through all that info and they the it's not organic anymore children growing up these days it's not organic it's sped up it's pushed
Ellie: uh huh
Participant: and it's just so hard for them to figure out who they are in this world so that's what's wrong
Ellie: yeah i see what you mean
Participant: hmm
Ellie: what do you do when you're annoyed
Participant: me <laughter> just <sharp inhale> breathe in <sharp exhale> and breathe out or i'll just walk away from the situation
Ellie: okay
Ellie: when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
Participant: argued
Participant: i argued with my fiancee uh a couple months ago about
