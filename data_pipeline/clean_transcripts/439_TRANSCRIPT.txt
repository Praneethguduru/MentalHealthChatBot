Ellie: good_hear (that's so good to hear)
Ellie: easy_parent (do you find it easy to be a parent)
Participant: you know what
Participant: if you build a foundation with your children
Participant: and have a good relationship with them
Participant: and talk to 'em and find out what's going on
Participant: and tell 'em that you love them uh my son i've taught them all the time when they went out the door i love you
Participant: and even today when they'll call me and hang up they say mom i love you
Participant: you always have to give them that that um good feeling when they leave the door
Participant: that you care
Participant: and uh i i've never had to go to <t> to <t> eh to any jail to get 'em out
Participant: um they've been pretty obedient i mean boys will be boys but um i never had any problem
Participant: as far as uh them getting into any serious trouble
Participant: and i'm very proud of that especially with boys i don't know how it would've been with a girls maybe a little different but <laughter> with boys i have to say they were pretty obedient and they respect the law
Ellie: yeah3 (yeah)
Ellie: wild_laughter3 ((laughter))
Ellie: parent_best (what's the best thing about being a parent)
Participant: uh the best thing is watching them grow and become parents themselves and see what they learn basically from you
Participant: and um i've watched my son like i said i just a recent grandmother and i watch him how he handles his son
Participant: and it's it seems like he's learned a lot from his foundation that he learned at home
Participant: on how to handle his son to be responsible to go to work every day and he knows that hey
Participant: i got a wife i have a son and it's my job to make sure that i keep a roof over their heads
Participant: so it pays off
Ellie: thats_great (that's great)
Participant: and i i basically he treats her well
Ellie: parent_differences (what are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents)
Participant: um my mother was more stricter on me <laughter> uh my my my parents um
Participant: for some unknown reason i i guess because i my sister and i we're the girls they they weren't strict on the boys but they were more strict on the girls
Participant: so they didn't let us go to a lot of places and then my parents also they weren't type that liked to travel
Participant: and i used to look at them and say no i'm not gonna be like them i'm gonna travel i'm not gonna just stay home i i mean i mean <me> there's nothing wrong with 'em because they
Participant: found love at home <laughter> and did things at home but they never really traveled anywhere and my mom used she was afraid of planes for one
Participant: and i used to try to talk her into get on a plane and go somewhere and she said oh i'm gonna go here i'm going to go there but she never did she died she never did do <d> do any travel
Participant: so i've made up for her
Participant: and uh i i want to do something different and that's to to travel more than and be more out there
Participant: i was more of a social butterfly my mother was a not a social butterfly
Participant: so i made up for it
Ellie: okay_confirm (okay)
Ellie: control_temper (how are you at controlling your temper)
Participant: i think before i speak
Participant: and then i am the type of person also to um
Participant: i take on other people's feelings before i um
Participant: blurt out the wrong thing i try to
Participant: uh analyze the situation first
Participant: before <bef> because sometimes you can put your <yo> open your mouth too soon and you can put yourself in something that you may not be able to get out of
Ellie: yeah2 (yeah)
Ellie: last_argument (when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about)
Participant: um
Participant: <laughter> it's probably something about my husband did <laughter> oh he <h> i know what it was it's about uh well probably over some construction <cons> new construction that my husband is working on on our house
Participant: uh we had a disagreement on that um
Participant: men have their own way of doing things and um
Participant: i had told him not to use a certain uh
Participant: eh person to work on our house
Participant: but because of the personal relationship he has with this person he went on ahead
Participant: and now he sees all the downfalls
Participant: and he didn't listen and so i didn't say i told you so
Participant: but i guess he can tell by my facial expression
Participant: that uh he he'd have done wrong and i told him i said look you're losing money
Participant: and it became one problem after another so now all the construction thing is up in the air right now 'cause he knows he has done wrong
Participant: and uh but he doesn't wanna face the fact that well he knows it but he doesn't wanna really face the fact so he says look it's my project no it's our project
Participant: so uh eh that that's one of the biggest arguments what we're having right now um
Participant: that i can think of that's recent
Ellie: describe_felt (how did you feel in that moment)
Participant: i felt that he <h> he <h> he didn't really listen to me
Participant: and he more so looked at uh a cheaper economical way that he can get this done without going through the proper ways 'cause i told him that um
Participant: you need to do your research
Participant: i'm the type of person i do my research before i jump into something i i i try to dot my i's and cross my t's
Participant: but my husband he's not like that he's like oh i can get this person can do this project for x amount of money
Participant: and he's a good friend of mine so i don't care i mean is he licensed
Participant: he doesn't look at all that stuff he's he just jumps into it <laughter>
Ellie: right2 (right)
Participant: which cost him some extra money unnecessary money that he spent when and then i mean it was a lot of money
Participant: and so i was really very upset yesterday and i was very upset about it because
Ellie: that_sucks (that sucks)
Participant: it was just wasted money that we could've saved 'cause we wind up doing the same thing all over again
Ellie: yeah_downer (yeah)
Participant: and it didn't make any sense
Ellie: situation_handled (tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently)
Participant: um
Participant: i retired early
Participant: um i was very fortunate to retire at age fifty i retired in two thousand and two i was working for the state of california
Participant: um as a disability analyst and what happened was i was able the reason why i was able to retire so early because i'd been working since i was eighteen
Participant: and i had like thirty one and a half years of service
Participant: and what was so nice about it that only needed <n> needed to vest in like ten years in my health insurance
Participant: so i was able to get full health insurance but the only thing about it when you retire i was with calpirg and i don't know if you're familiar with calpirg but
Participant: um we we have a excellent retirement system and since i had been working with them so long
Participant: um
Participant: i didn't get the full percentage i should've stayed 'til i was fifty five but i got out at fifty and i didn't get the full amount but that's okay
Participant: um eh i i found myself going back doing a little part-time job
Participant: because of the economical reason and then i have wantitis <laughter> so um
Participant: i think that was the kind of mistake i did i should've kinda waited 'til i was fifty five than fifty but i look at it now as far as the health insurance i really benefited because of the rising cost of the health insurance have went up
Participant: and i don't i pay very little money
Participant: so i think that over uh negates the uh uh uh the money that i receive
Ellie: yeah3 (yeah)
Ellie: hard_decisionB (tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make)
Participant: um
Participant: let me see the hardest
Participant: it's probably when my mom died 'cause uh i'm not used to anybody dying
Participant: and my mother um
Participant: died in ninety nine of uh non-hodgkin lymphoma
Participant: and
Participant: i i xxx putting her funeral together um my brother and sister we never we would never face anybody dying
Participant: or putting a funeral together and all the responsibility <responsi> because i am the eldest it was put in me
Participant: and i'm like oh my god what do i do xxx
Participant: and so um i was kinda like left out there trying to find her insurance policy 'cause i had asked her to make sure she put everything in order
Participant: and she never got to it so the hardest thing was going through her house and trying to get all the stuff together and finding things
Participant: you know i myself i keep my things organized but um for some unknown reason she didn't have hers organized and
Participant: i think that was the hardest and knowing how much i had to pay 'cause i had to come out of pocket on some of my stuff
Participant: and unfortunately my mom <laughter> this is interesting
Participant: she had one little small barrel insurance but she had million dollar of accident insurance and she didn't die of course with with accident she had
Participant: a medical condition so that was something so we had to pay for the whole just about everything
Ellie: been_hard (that sounds really hard)
Participant: yeah it was it was but
Participant: and now i can handle i i i um <laughter> this will sound weird but um
Participant: since that i've learned from that so i have made it available for my children
Participant: that my husband and i we got together
Participant: and we wind up getting our insurance uh uh uh uh policy xxx not insurance policy but um
Participant: what do you call the um
Participant: barrel insurance we had that
Participant: and it just we've had it for mm many many years so it's almost paid but xxx ten years it'll pay for everything um the plot and everything
Participant: and uh another thing that i did i've even written my own obituary i know that sounds weird
Participant: so
Participant: my son
Participant: make one phone call that's it i don't want them to go through what
Participant: i went through
Participant: and my husband agreed that's the one thing we did agree on
Ellie: makes_sense (that makes sense)
Participant: and um
Participant: he said he don't want anybody to to have any problem uh people coming in and telling 'em what to do it's already written we did a living trust
Participant: i mean it's nothing they can do but make one phone call
Ellie: mhm (mhm)
Participant: and that's it
Ellie: easy_sleep (how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep)
Participant: i have no problem sleeping i sleep very <laughter> well
Participant: pretty good

Ellie: good_hear (that's so good to hear)
Ellie: BF_describe (how would your best friend describe you)
Participant: oh uh resource person i've been um
Participant: described as a resource person from my supervisor
Participant: to from my friends because i'm the type of person i research everything i get into just about
Participant: i just don't  xxx dive into any situation i try to look up information uh
Participant: some i know we have the technology here uh that you can get everything on the internet but also go back to the old school like like even finding this place
Participant: i mean i did the map google but also i love the thomas brother i'm never gonna give up my thomas brothers map
Participant: yellow pages you'd be surprised i don't give up my yellow pages so there's certain little things that i don't really let go i know we have technology but
Participant: sometimes you know you'd be surprised that you can go around and find a whole lot of stuff
Participant: that even though technology gives <gi> you have it right at your finger but you can find things
Participant: and and they say i'm more of a resource person and most people come to me just to to look up things
Participant: and i get that that that spunk about it because i like to look for stuff and find it
Ellie: uh_huh (uh huh)
