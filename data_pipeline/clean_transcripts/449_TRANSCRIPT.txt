Ellie: travel_trips (i'd love to hear about one of your trips)
Participant: um recently i went to honduras again that's where my family's from
Participant: so it was sort of like a it's it's a dual fold i get to see my family but i also kinda get to be away from home
Participant: so i do it by not imposing on them i visit them but i stay in a hotel so that way i can still kinda have my freedom
Participant: and not feel like i'm obligated to being with them so it's more fun that way
Ellie: makes_sense (that makes sense)
Ellie: memorableB (what's one of your most memorable experiences)
Participant: experiences on vacation or
Ellie: yeah3 (yeah)
Participant: um most memorable experience
Participant: probably hawaii in lahaina and just having i love food i'm a foodie so
Participant: having the pig roasted underground and just eating it that way it just i've never been able to taste it that way any time else so it's like a very memory it's a deep memory for me 'cause

Ellie: wild_laughter3 ((laughter))
Ellie: awesome (awesome)
Ellie: study (what did you study at school)
Participant: business and that was years ago so i ended up in the marketing field
Participant: so i've enjoyed i my business background did help me in the marketing field
Ellie: dream_job (what's your dream job)
Participant: my dream job
Participant: hmm
Participant: well i guess it would have to do with food i love to cook
Participant: and the only reason i hesitate is because i love to cook but i just do it for home and friends and family
Participant: if it were to turn into in if it were to turn into a job i feel as if it would just not be as joyous or i wouldn't have as much fun as i do have it you know as i have now
Participant: but if i could just do it as a job and still have the fun and the joy that i have in cooking every day now then that would be my dream job
Ellie: yeah3 (yeah)
Ellie: shyoutgoing (do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing)
Participant: i'm outgoing
Ellie: relax_fishtank (sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax)
Participant: <laughter>
Participant: <laughter> that's cool <laughter>
Participant: uh depends on where i'm at if i'm wherever i'm at actually the first thing i do is just kinda get a hold of myself that way i'm always in control no matter where i'm standing at
Participant: and always say that i am my own peace p a p e a c e
Participant: so i just kinda just take a deep breath assess my situation
Participant: figure out what i can control what i can't control and then proceed from there but just sort of just kinda <deep breath> <sigh> breathe and get a hold of myself first
Ellie: mhm (mhm)
Ellie: control_temper (how are you at controlling your temper)
Participant: i'm actually very good i'm actually very mild-tempered to begin with
Participant: um i don't really let anything agitate me
Participant: and so if i do feel myself just getting hot or if i just react i just sort of just like i said i just
Participant: do my own little self check you know eh i might've cussed i might've went off for a second but i do my own little self check and just say you know what come on no this is mm it's not worth it this person's not worth it the situation is not worth it
Participant: be who you are and just stay there
Ellie: last_argument (when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about)
Participant: actually it was with my husband and we were going back and forth about my relationship with my father and i was trying to get a point across to him and he was just kinda overlooking my feelings in it
Participant: and i was i didn't want him to overlook my feelings and act as if i wasn't feeling the way i was feeling so i kept stressing my point in different ways
Participant: and then i found myself now in a debate and then that's when i pulled back and said no look babe this is how i feel about it i'm not asking you to make me feel any differently i'm just asking you to acknowledge my feelings
Ellie: describe_felt (how did you feel in that moment)
Participant: when i got to my own conclusion i felt triumphant because
Participant: the point of the argument in my mind was to clarify how i felt not for him to impose his you know he's very a macho kinda manly guy i didn't want him to just overshadow my feelings with his logic
Participant: and so i said no as long as i i felt better because i he i felt undestood and i felt heard
Ellie: mm (mm)
Ellie: situation_handled (tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently)
Participant: hmm <sigh> let's see
Participant: i can my son comes to mind he's twenty two years old
Participant: and he we have a very estranged relationship right now and it's okay i'm okay with it
Participant: he's used to be being a little bit more needy so he i think he assumed that i would just always look xxx go looking for him or call for him
Participant: as opposed to waiting him to call me
Participant: and i think
Participant: it may be a very weird answer but i wish early on in my life as his mother i would've kind of adjusted that so that he wouldn't be so comfortable waiting for me to be the one to come
Participant: and check on him he doesn't live with me he has his own place
Participant: but waiting for me to be the one to come and look for him and you know try to make sure that he's okay i think this is probably way more <laughter> ethereal than you meant but
Participant: i would've i would've done that differently i would've mothered him differently along the way and released him at an earlier age meaning that i would've treated him more of an adult
Participant: and then also not expected him to just kinda you know
Participant: i would've killed the expectation in him for me to contour to him if that makes sense
Ellie: uh_huh (uh huh)
Ellie: easy_parent (do you find it easy to be a parent)
Participant: woo <laughter> no it's not easy you have to sacrifice and beyond just physical things you have to just make sure you put your kid's needs ahead of your own and
Participant: i guess the second part of that answer is that it is easy once you realize that as long as they're okay you're okay so
Participant: it my my son my daughter they both know i love them unconditionally
Participant: so
Participant: my parenting has become easier the more and more i've lived in that truth where i'm not expecting anything from them but then also not expecting any disrespect
Participant: so as long as we have that clear line of communication whatever else is going on falls under that category of respect
Ellie: thats_good (that's good)
Ellie: parent_hardest (what's the hardest thing about being a parent)
Participant: seeing them maybe make decisions that i wish they wouldn't make uh it could be as simple as an outfit <laughter> you know choice or as much as a career change
Participant: but um having to sit back watch them listen be open and then just
Participant: kinda just be there you know if they wanna talk about it but then not also also trying not to manage them because i was also their age and i have to remember that
Participant: i i didn't wanna be managed and even if i made a mistake i didn't wanna be judged so the difficult part is just watching them go through the process on their own
Participant: and just sort of kinda just waiting around and luckily it's nothing major with my kids but
Participant: whatever that personal downfall is just kinda being there and not having an i told you i told you so um spirit on me
Ellie: yeah_downer (yeah)
Ellie: parent_best (what's the best thing about being a parent)
Participant: it's fulfilling knowing that you know i created this you know i planned both my kids so it's just it's a real
Participant: it's an honor that i was able to do it it's an honor that they're healthy
Participant: um and it's fun watching them sort of just kind of grow into their own
Participant: and it's like they're mini me's but then they're also different than i am and so it's fun just
Participant: being able to allow them uh be who they are and just celebrate them as they are so i'm enjoying that
Ellie: parent_differences (what are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents)
Participant: wow completely my parents immigrated here from central america in the sixties um i was born the year after they got here
Participant: so their their mentality was different they wanted to come and get the american lifestyle eh which was not a bad thing
Participant: it's just that their parenting style was more about um making sure we had a home making sure
Participant: uh we had the shelter of course and food and clothes and schooling
Participant: but there was not really a lot of time spent on the relationship from my mother to daughter to me as a daughter or my father to me as a daughter
Participant: so i had to kinda figure it out on my own when it came to being a parent
Ellie: hard_decisionB (tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make)
Participant: divorcing my first husband um 'cause i was gonna be the one that toppled that whole situation um he was a good father just not a good husband to me
Participant: and after twenty years i knew that i was gonna be the one to say this is not working for me anymore
Participant: and
Participant: since i did that the domino effect has <ha> was is this is not virtual it happened <laughter> we ended up selling our house you know dividing up the assets and then living separately and then my kids were kind of in between for a little while
Participant: um and then i just made some decisions to where i didn't wanna go through so much court hassle so i just
Participant: did a tina turner and said just give me my name you keep everything else so it was just a very hard decision by way of
Participant: how it affected my kids that's all i cared about in terms of losing everything
Participant: physical and and all the material stuff i could care less
Participant: but it was hard because i i knew it was gonna affect my kids and they were the only thing i was concerned about
Ellie: change_directions (what made you decide to do that)
Participant: uh my husband and i did not you know see eye to eye on certain things xxx regarding our marriage he i didn't feel validated as a woman or as a wife and that's just who i am and those were the very areas that
Participant: he didn't validate me in he just kinda saw me as a partner who was helping fund his extracurriculars whether it was just travel or or whatever the case may be i'm not i'm not here to talk about that part of it
Participant: bottom line is that whatever he was doing was outside of you know the sanctity of our home
Participant: and i was tired of just you know working and and and him benefiting from everything but then not being fulfilled as a woman or a wife and he wasn't prepared to change xxx despite all the counseling we went through
Participant: and i thought well this is not working for me and i have to take care of myself first and i i had low self-esteem i you know i wasn't perfect i had a lot of things going on with myself and i had to learn how to love myself
Participant: in order to uh in order for me to love my children and then in order for me to get the love that i should get in return
Ellie: downer (okay)
Participant: <laughter>
Ellie: easy_sleep (how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep)
Participant: you know what it's actually pretty easy because at the end of the day i just you know good bad ugly or indifferent whatever mistakes i made that day or whatever great thing went on that day
Participant: my goal in life is just to have peace of mind so when i put my head down at night
Participant: i i just i ask myself did you know did i do anything that i'm ashamed of today did i cross anybody
Participant: did i not do you know and i'm not being sanctimonious or acting as if i'm pollyanna but i believe in karma
Participant: i'm a god-fearing woman so i just wanna make sure that i did everything i was supposed to do today
Participant: and if there's something that i can rectify you know i just make it a point to promise to myself to
Participant: go back and rectify it or at least learn from that and just not make that same mistake in another day
Ellie: thats_good (that's good)
Ellie: feel_lately (how have you been feeling lately)
Participant: really good light um you know had some rough patches with the family individually like i said with my son
Participant: my daughter's a teenager so she's kinda coming into her own so that's a different relationship she's opposite of me i'm i'm actually very easygoing very bohemian style she's very social very you know just out there so i'm having to just kinda find our balance
Participant: but overall it's just i i won't complain i'm very happy for a very simplistic lifestyle
Participant: that i just kinda foster on my own every day and i just enjoy my little
Participant: mini accomplishments whether anyone sees them or not
Ellie: okay_confirm (okay)
Participant: <laughter>
Ellie: ptsd_diagnosed (have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d)
Participant: no i haven't thank god
Ellie: depression_diagnosed (have you been diagnosed with depression)
Participant: no
Ellie: happy_lasttime (tell me about the last time you felt really happy)
Participant: really happy let's see
Participant: uh it's at home and i think it was when
Participant: wow
Participant: <mumbling> different things running through my head um
Participant: i think when my daughter and i my teenage daughter and i came to understanding <underst> eh understanding on
Participant: our mother daughter relationship i'm not trying to be her best friend but yet that doesn't mean she can't talk to me
Participant: and i think when she came to me the other day and just kinda gave me a big hug from behind me
Participant: without really saying anything i really felt her just accepting herself
Participant: and she accepted the fact that i accept who she is as she is so it was a very
Participant: tame moment only she and i kinda knew about it but it just it gave just a happiness that nothing else could ever give me
Ellie: aw (aw)
Participant: <laughter>
Ellie: good_hear (that's so good to hear)
Participant: thank you
Ellie: BF_describe (how would your best friend describe you)
Participant: um <laughter> i'm easygoing i'm fun i'm just very
Participant: you know um eh chameleon comes to mind i just kinda acclimate to what whatever situation i'm in i'm very honest i'm very real and just you know bold if i have to be
Participant: um i'm just very adult i'm an adult woman and you know they would just decribe <descr> or my best friend would describe me as someone that she can rely on extremely reliable i do as i say i say what i do
Participant: and i just you know i don't
Participant: i don't deal with b s <laughter>
Ellie: mhm (mhm)
Ellie: self_change (what are some things you wish you could change about yourself)
Participant: hmm what could i change about myself
Participant: uh probably cosmetic things maybe i would just uh that's not even true let me think what what what are some things i would change about myself
Participant: um sounds weird that i would say not much <m> nothing really um
Participant: i think i would just be
Participant: a little bit more aware of others i think i'm a i'm super sensitive to others but i think i would just be more aware
Participant: make sure that i'm not being selfish or i'm not tuning anyone out just because i wanna get through my yoga or i wanna do something else i think i would just be more um observant and aware of those around me to make sure i'm not offending anybody
Ellie: uh_huh (uh huh)
Ellie: regret (is there anything you regret)
Participant: i don't have any regrets i i think about that all the time and you know it's it's natural to go back and say if i were in that situation with the mindset i have now what would i do eh but the reality is that i know that everything that has happened up to this point has shaped me
Participant: so i can't you know very well take the benefit from it and then turn around and call it a regret
Participant: because i know i learned from it um probably sounds very textbook but that's true that's just really how i live so i believe that
Participant: everything good bad ugly or indifferent happened for a reason i truly believe that and my job is to take from it
Participant: what i'm supposed to take from it and take that into my future so i'm to take the you know the hard knocks with the with the joys
Ellie: understand (i understand)
Ellie: advice_back (what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago)
Participant: hmm
Participant: be real with myself that's that's one thing that took me twenty years to kinda get to um just to kinda be honest with myself to embrace who i am
Participant: to just you know get to know who i am uh learn my own infrastructure
Participant: be comfortable with the uh with the innate things that are a part of me
Participant: don't try to revamp <re>
Participant: don't try to revamp myself or try to become something that i'm not
Participant: uh i would've still chosen the same marketing career to still i would've still climbed the same corporate ladders
Participant: but i would've done it from a more internal place um not that i lost myself in it
Participant: but when in terms of my family life i would've just been more true to myself and that way i wouldn't have had any kind of resentments
Ellie: Ellie17Dec2012_08 (what are you most proud of in your life)
Participant: my family my uh my role as a wife my role as a mother i think that ultimately that's where my main fulfillment comes from because no matter what
Participant: at the end of this life's this life uh this body uh in this leased vehicle
Participant: that i'm in um all i'm gonna do or all i'm gonna be is an epitaph <laughter> somewhere in a cementary
Participant: scrubbed_entry
Participant: and i'm always just
Participant: true to that i mean i i've been always true to that from the time i was eighteen and realized i wanted to be married and have a family and kids and all that
Participant: i think that ultimately that that's where my true fulfillment comes from
Ellie: yeah3 (yeah)
