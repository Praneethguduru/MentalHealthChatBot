Participant: oh uh my daughter
Ellie: aww
Ellie: tell me about your kids
Participant: i just have one daughter who graduated u_c_l_a law school and uh i raised her totally alone without any help so it seemed like an accomplishment that was was worth it the the two jobs and the work
Ellie: wow
Ellie: yeah
Ellie: do you find it easy to be a parent
Participant: uh i think it's difficult i think it's a difficult job that takes a lot more work than most people give it credit for if you wanna do it right you know it's always second guessing your behavior and that kind of thing
Ellie: mhm
Ellie: what's the hardest thing about being a parent
Participant: uh just uh i'd say peer pressure
Participant: it can totally alter [al] alter anything a parent has tried to put into a child that's good
Ellie: yeah
Ellie: can you give me an example of that
Participant: scrubbed_entry
Participant: so that was a really bad time for us
Ellie: that sounds really hard
Ellie: what do you think of today's kids
Participant: um i think it depends on which neighborhood or state you're in or the the uh
Participant: i i think they're a little misguided i think a little uninspired [unin] uninspired right now
Participant: i think they're being weighed down by the concerns of the wars and um and things like that and i think they can probably use a
Participant: uh a common goal a common you know now a team uh as as oppposed to just being more separated group than a family [fam] once they were i think
Participant: you know kind of uninspired right now
Ellie: yeah
Ellie: i see what you mean
Ellie: how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep
Participant: um i worry sometimes about you know work issues but it's pretty pretty easy
Ellie: do you feel that way often
Participant: um no i i don't feel like i'm not sleeping i i just you know will occasionally worry about something at work
Ellie: when was the last time that happened
Participant: oh gosh about a couple weeks ago
Ellie: how did you feel in that moment
Participant: oh just uh you know unfortunately we have to worry you know i'm fortunate this isn't easier it's just cooperation between people uh it solves most everything you know so you always wanna have that around you
Ellie: mhm
Ellie: what are you like when you don't sleep well
Participant: um just stressed
Participant: yeah stressed more stressed
Ellie: that sounds really hard
Participant: mhm
Ellie: do you feel down
Participant: um yeah fatigue has uh a lot of uh you know a lot of implications for just not feeling like yourself or misjudging things that you might judge differently if you were more well rested
Ellie: yeah
Ellie: have you been diagnosed with depression
Participant: uh not depression
Ellie: have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d
Participant: um probably yeah i was that was considered a possibility i had an employment lawsuit several years ago and and uh actually litigated it and won the settlement um something about whistleblower thing implications [im] implications of that and um and i was kind of harrassed about it and so i found when i got out of it i couldn't find work right away in my own field so i had to go into a different field go back to u_c_l_a and get a new uh professional direction and
Participant: i found myself fearful sometimes that it's gonna happen again you know and you think that would never happen again you know
Ellie: mhm
Ellie: i'm sorry to hear that
Ellie: what got you to seek help
Participant: um just that i was noticing that i was noticing i was feeling very uh in my paralegal class i had a a section about employment law
Participant: and there was a a very complicated filing i had done with great a deal of work and study for my case but once faced with it again in that class setting i just i just couldn't get it done it was a late paper from me and i realized i was traumatized by having to go through that again um that you know yeah post traumatic stress sometimes comes later after the adrenaline dies down
Ellie: yeah
Participant: from what i understand and um so i think it was just uh it was just hitting me later you know that i was having to face that paper again and wow you know no adrenaline just wow
Participant: there is a xxxx
Ellie: hmm
Participant: back back
Ellie: what were your symptoms
Participant: just uh just extreme uh you know avoidance of getting something done that should've been easy for me
Participant: and uh and thinking about it as thoroughly as i should've or studying it or putting it off uh putting the feeling of going through that paper that type of paper even if it's just a class assignment again
Participant: you know
Ellie: yeah
Ellie: have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately
Participant: well um not lately um you know back then for sure when that happened which was about ten years ago now it was settled in court about seven years ago now
Participant: and uh yeah it was it was effective you know it was effective in the way you view most everything and in your confidence and that kinda thing
Ellie: do you feel like therapy is useful
Participant: i'm sorry [laughter] repeat the question
Ellie: do you feel like therapy is useful
Participant: uh peaceful do i feel peaceful well yeah i was peaceful that it that it's settled uh but but angry that it ever happened
Participant: so it's hard to i'll probably not ever feel peaceful about that issue ever it always
Participant: the mention of it always makes me angry that i had to go through that yeah
Ellie: yeah
Ellie: could you have done anything to avoid it
Participant: i don't think so i tried everything to avoid it [laughter] you know and so uh
Participant: uh i think that's that was aggravating for me too because i'm a patient person realistic and um and i tried everything to avoid uh confrontation in the matter but it was just required to try to you know help me cover the damage to our lives my daughter's life
Ellie: yeah
Ellie: do you consider yourself an introvert
Participant: i uh not now maybe one time in my life not now you if you can't communicate uh you know if you could communicate you could overcome people's perceptions or their judgments of you if you can
Participant: effectively explain something and and uh it will help you overcome other perceptions of yourself
Participant: that others might normally have judgments for age or anything like that
Ellie: yeah
Ellie: what's one of your most memorable experiences
