Participant: that i found to be too hot and humid in florida i love the weather here
Participant: um i like the culture i like the diversity
Participant: i like the familiarity
Participant: i like that beaches
Participant: uh but i also like that just an hour and a half away one can go to the desert say palm springs palm desert
Participant: but also another hour and a half two hours away you can go to arrowhead or big bear and go snowboarding or skiing or things like that
Participant: and uh i think it's a great place to live
Ellie: yeah2 (yeah)
Ellie: see_mean (i see what you mean)
Participant: thank you
Ellie: dont_like_LA (what are some things you don't really like about l_a)
Participant: well
Participant: more of some maybe some of the
Participant: things i don't like about l_a or say california in general
Participant: say like the high tax rate
Participant: which the state tax rate is up to thirteen point something now
Participant: which is gonna chase business out of here also the regulations
Participant: i'm a small business owner
Participant: so all the regulations are clearly affecting business so many of my peers have moved their businesses to texas arizona nevada etcetera some of the other western states that are less regulated
Participant: and uh that's a big problem here in uh
Participant: uh california
Ellie: that_sucks (that sucks)
Participant: it really does most people don't understand it but  it's uh
Participant: also uh
Participant: you know besides the high taxes you know there's a big immigration problem which being born and raised here most people don't
Participant: see that but it's a big tax on the social service system
Participant: and that's what makes our taxes
Participant: uh so high until they really secure the borders and get that taken care of
Ellie: mm (mm)
Participant: so that's
Participant: you know but people don't seem to want to really deal with uh deal with that but it clearly affects businesses because from all the other things that's why our taxes are so high and people are moving out of state
Ellie: mhm (mhm)
Ellie: travel_shoes (i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot)
Participant: i enjoy traveling i've been to sixty six countries
Participant: and uh
Participant: i don't travel as much as i used to
Participant: but i've traveled quite a bit
Participant: and i've learned a couple of languages and uh
Participant: i served
Ellie: like_what (like what)
Participant: i'm sorry
Ellie: like_what (like what)
Participant: uh
Participant: i didn't really understand uh your question
Participant: when you said like what i don't think you understood what i said but i'll just go back and
Participant: i've been all through europe eastern europe
Participant: asia
Participant: south america
Participant: north africa
Participant: um and i enjoy that and enjoy warm climates now especially where you can go and relax and there's warm water to surf
Participant: 'cause the cold water kind of makes my back stiffen up
Participant: and i also like to exercise and surf and do yoga
Participant: and work out and uh
Participant: i try to eat healthy and uh
Participant: that's a big part of my life
Ellie: travel_trips (i'd love to hear about one of your trips)
Participant: oh
Participant: sure
Participant: um one of my favorite trips of all time was i used to when i was younger see how many countries i could do in a relatively short period of time say in a three or four week span
Participant: but about ten years ago we actually went to paris and stayed for about a week and really got to know the city even though i'd been there about ten times
Participant: we got to know the city really well which was great really lived like a local
Participant: and rented a small flat and
Participant: cooked and did our own shopping but really
Participant: having been there so many times i really never stayed for more than three or four days
Participant: it was fun to stay there for about you know almost a month and uh really get to learn the city
Participant: and it was fun even though i grew up in l_a i grew up taking french
Participant: which there wasn't a big spanish speaking population when i when i was younger
Participant: my mother insisted that all of us kids
Participant: take french even though spanish would've been a lot more valuable but i took french uh
Participant: all through uh elementary junior high and uh high school
Ellie: nice (nice)
Participant: so it was nice to practice my french even though i don't remember a whole lot and even though i stopped speaking french
Participant: with the french
Participant: you know and my accent is not the greatest so after a couple sentences they start talking english to me
Ellie: wild_laughter3 ((laughter))
Participant: <laughter> so that was a
Ellie: study (what did you study at school)
Participant: uh
Participant: i have a few different degrees
Participant: so uh i was a naval science major as an undergraduate
Participant: and uh
Participant: that was fun
Participant: and i also have a masters
Participant: uh degree in economics
Participant: and i have a degree in crisis management
Participant: so
Ellie: change_directions (what made you decide to do that)
Participant: uh i found them um
Participant: interesting
Participant: and uh
Participant: it was something that i wanted to do
Participant: where i went to college i went to the naval academy i went there to play sports
Participant: and  i found it real interesting being from southern california going to school in maryland
Participant: and i originally wanted to be a doctor but
Participant: once you start going to school
Participant: for a little bit you change your mind
Participant: etcetera so
Ellie: mhm (mhm)
Ellie: still_working_on_X (are you still working in that)
Participant: um i'm actually in the wholesale business now
Participant: for wholesale distributors of furniture products
Participant: and it was a family business but i went to work there a number of years ago
Participant: well you know my grandfather and recently father passed away so i sort of run a eighty year old family business
Participant: and it's
Participant: pretty interesting i like it having grown up around it
Participant: but it's different than other jobs i've had in the past
Ellie: dream_job (what's your dream job)
Participant: hm
Participant: actually probably my dream job i think cooking and staying at home this fun i've changed so much i enjoy cooking and staying at home
Participant: and uh
Participant: uh
Participant: i would probably like to stay home and raise kids because i do have one daughter
Participant: and uh
Ellie: aw (aw)
Participant: you know didn't get to spend as much time with her when she was younger as i would've liked
Participant: but i think i would be better than say a lot of women i know  that want to work i actually like cooking and hanging around the house and taking care of kids
Participant: you know that i like doing i'm always on a part time basis but do that having pretty much worked most of my life it seems like boy that would be fun to stay home and uh do that having pretty much worked most of my life
Participant: so
Ellie: yeah3 (yeah)
Participant: probably never happen but it sounds something that to me would be fun
Ellie: shyoutgoing (do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing)
Participant: uh i think i'm um generally more reserved and shy with strangers
Participant: but when i get to know someone or feel comfortable
Participant: i think i'm more of an extrovert
Participant: whereas most strangers might think i'm more introverted
Participant: but i think i'm when i feel comfortable with certain people and i don't know what it is i can meet a stranger and  be totally confident or people that i might've known for years either from a personal or a business situation
Participant: and be more um
Participant: introverted
Participant: i mean i just i just go with the dynamics but i think my outward manifestation is to be a little more shy in general and reserved <reser> i use like to use the term reserved
Ellie: okay_confirm (okay)
Ellie: relax_fishtank (sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax)
Participant: oh wow that's a great idea i used to have that on uh
Participant: one of my i have uh several computers at home
Participant: and that used to be one of my screensavers uh as well
Participant: i usually tend when when i need to relax or had a stressful day or stressful personal events or going for a long walk or going for a long walk or going for a long walk i usually find exercise whether it be yoga or going for a long walk or going to the gym or going for a run or going to the beach
Participant: you know maybe going surfing when the weather's warm i don't surf in cold weather anymore because it makes
Participant: it gives me like a brain freeze even though i've surfed for you know over thirty years
Participant: i had
Participant: it uh
Participant: i usually find exercise helps me relax the best
Participant: or sometimes just vegging out on the couch in front of the t_v i find very relaxing <laughter>
Participant: but i like that screensaver i used to have that on one of my uh screensavers at home but
Ellie: thats_great (that's great)
Participant: yes that was uh
Participant: that was it but
Participant: that's one of the things that took me a number of years to master though were my relaxation skills
Participant: i probably didn't have them the best in my twenties but over the years
Participant: i think i've gotten better
Participant: uh at the
Ellie: yeah2 (yeah)
Participant: i think that's a key thing and i think as we mature
Participant: as we learn how to do that i wish i'd learned how to do that and
Participant: be a little more
Participant: how do you had had the skills earlier
Ellie: control_temper (how are you at controlling your temper)
Participant: i like to think i'm pretty good i think i'm a lot better as well as that as i've aged
Participant: um
Participant: you know i
Participant: i am more likely to think before i speak now
Participant: whereas say twenty years ago i was more likely to act before i fought
Participant: so i might've said more things that i
Participant: in a whatever tense situation whether it be personal or
Participant: a work situation
Participant: um
Participant: but i've never had a a a violent temper but i would have a temper where i fly off the handle instead of taking a deep breath and reflecting on it
Participant: i think i'm a lot better at that  now than i was say in my teens or twenties
Ellie: uh_huh (uh huh)
Participant: so when i think a lot of that comes i think the keyword there is maturity
Ellie: last_argument (when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about)
Participant: oh wow
Participant: you know i haven't really had an argument with anybody in several years <y> what i would consider a traditional
Participant: argument um
Participant: probably
Participant: um
Participant: my ex wife a number of years ago wehad an argument basically just over my daughter
Participant: and it wasn't anything violent but it was heated just
Participant: basically one of the reasons we didn't weren't married our values were so different just our ideas of parenting
Participant: and uh just
Participant: uh outlook on life was so different i think that caused
Participant: us to butt heads but it was just i don't know if i'd call it an argument
Participant: but it was more of just a uh one of those let's agree to disagree
Participant: butt heads
Participant: so
Ellie: describe_felt (how did you feel in that moment)
Participant: i felt like i was talking to a wall
Participant: and i actually felt more mad at myself that i should've
Participant: learned earlier in life that boy that before you get married to someone have children with them that's the kind of discussions that people should
Participant: usually have but you're not really thinking of that because
Participant: sometimes when we're younger we're
Participant: looking at boy how does that i look great on paper to her and she looked great on paper to me
Participant: but you know
Participant: i'm pretty easy going and i have
Participant: different
Participant: ideas on raising children how she did
Participant: and that was more
Participant: not that she was wrong and i was right not that i was right and she was wrong it was just how we were raised and our just different views and we never really
Participant: discussed those things but it was really just fundamental
Participant: reasons why we butted heads and more weren't really a good match
Ellie: yeah_downer (yeah)
Participant: whereas other things looked good
Participant: you know on paper to both of us
Ellie: mhm (mhm)
Ellie: situation_handled (tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently)
Participant: hm
Participant: there's one recently my father passed away uh recently
Ellie: im_sorry (i'm sorry)
Participant: thank you
Participant: and
Participant: really because in our religion you know you plan a funeral very quickly you know typically within a couple of days
Participant: and i really only invited very very close friends and family members
Participant: i was more or less in charge of it my dad was remarried but his widow was sort of
Participant: not really up to it so i took care of it and i wish i had invited a
Participant: i kept it very private and really just told people after the fact
Participant: that he knew that would've liked to have come tp the service had they known
Participant: about it so i really only invited because just the time pressure really just a handful of people but
Participant: now as time's passed i wish i'd invited
Participant: more of his friends instead of just two or three close friends
Participant: you know ten or twenty acquaintances and people he knew from business or over the years and i really just
Participant: and even distant family members i really just told after the fact i really didn't invite them because
Participant: i was under a time pressure but i could've easily done it via email or it's hard to call everybody personally but
Participant: i wish that's something 'cause people have expressed a little
Participant: they were upset with me when my other family members threw it all back at me oh you didn't tell me 'til after the fact that
Participant: you know so and so had passed so they all threw it at me because i was more or less
Participant: doing it so i wish i i did that differently but i did the best i could at the time so i'm not really
Participant: mad at myself about something i probably should've been more prepared for also something <s s something> that was coming was inevitable so
Ellie: isee_downer (i see)
Ellie: family_relationship (tell me about your relationship with your family)
Participant: um well both my parents are recently
Participant: uh deceased in the last couple of years
Participant: and i had a brother that i have three younger brothers one of who passed away
Participant: in december
Participant: and
Participant: we're not super close like i always like i look at other families
Participant: we were just never like that norman rockwell uh painting
Participant: i guess we're also uh different
Ellie: Ellie17Dec2012_02 (uh huh)
Participant: and uh
Participant: i have a close relationship with friends and a more distant relationship with family
Participant: not that it's strange but i wish it was more like boy one of those families that got together every sunday and had dinner and all that
Participant: we just
Participant: never did that because we're all
Participant: all so uh
Participant: uh different
Ellie: yeah2 (yeah)
Ellie: understand (i understand)
Participant: yeah it's yeah just being that's how it is but
Participant: you know to strangers and most people i just say you know howdy the family everybody's great you know
Participant: but i think every family has their own sort of
Participant: stuff
Ellie: ptsd_diagnosed (have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d)
Participant: um no but i thought probably i could've had it before from
Participant: some other events in my life and i just wasn't sure i've had been to some therapy in the past just from
Participant: you know uh i was in the military and i was never really sure if that that's exactly what it was
Participant: but i think i function
Participant: pretty well but i just wasn't sure that i had been to some therapy and counseling over the years
Ellie: why_enlist (why'd you decide to enlist in the military)
Participant: i didn't enlist i was an officer
Participant: i went to one of the service academies
Ellie: old (how old were you when you joined the military)
Participant: that
Participant: um seventeen i started when after high school
Participant: and i went to a service academy
Participant: so it's more prestige it just isn't enlisting it's the hard where i went it's the hardest school in america to get into
Ellie: very_young (you were very young weren't you)
Participant: i was but same age as everybody else that went there
Ellie: combat (did you ever see combat)
Participant: uh we did
Participant: nineteen eighty three
Ellie: tell_about_that (can you tell me about that)
Participant: um
Participant: just basically wasn't anything intense it was just we were just around some we were just
Participant: we weren't allowed to carry ammunition we were just our position were just shelled
Participant: at the time
Participant: and poison gas was sprayed on us
Participant: so
Ellie: Ellie17Dec2012_06 (wow)
Participant: that was a
Participant: it wasn't it wasn't anything too uh
Participant: too intense it was a lot you know because it the service i was in the training was way more intense than any actual combat situation
Ellie: why2 (why)
Participant: that's because they train you well it's like you practice harder than you play if you're an athlete if you play football you practice harder than you
Participant: you actually play in the game and the same with uh
Participant: you know if you're in a combat
Participant: unit
Ellie: mhm (mhm)
Ellie: effectB (how did serving in the military change you)
Participant: well it made me more patriotic having grown up
Participant: in california
Participant: whereas people who are from all over the country
Participant: and i got to meet whereas most of say my friends who grew up in affluent los angeles like i did
Participant: never really went out and met a lot of americans and people from different backgrounds and i
Participant: ended up becoming uh
Participant: just more patriotic and a deeper sense of pride in the country
Participant: whereas you really don't grow up with that in southern california whereas someone in texas or kentucky or tennessee or
Participant: georgia north dakota south dakota montana
Ellie: right2 (right)
Participant: grows up with that kind of uh
Participant: pride so i thought it was good and it
Participant: unlike so many of my friends that
Participant: they don't know any there's any life between malibu and manhattan
Ellie: after (what did you do after the military)
Participant: uh i went to graduate i was still in the reserves but i went to graduate school
Participant: and i got two graduate degrees
Participant: and i went to work in private enterprise
Participant: uh
Participant: didn't care for it
Participant: then i joined the fire department i was a fire fighter and paramedic
Participant: for a number of years and
Participant: then after i got divorced it was harder to do the custody situation with my daughter so i went to work in a family business and that's pretty much my career in a nutshell
Ellie: civilian_life (how easy was it for you to go back to civilian life)
Participant: um
Participant: at first it was because i had such a bearing in my butt from the way i walked i talked
Participant: and again i was an officer
Participant: uh you were very regimented on the way you dressed in your private time it was harder took me awhile
Participant: to be able to come back to los angeles
Participant: uh
Participant: because it was just so uh
Participant: so different i think i handled it better than most i have a stronger personality
Participant: so but
Ellie: mm (mm)
Participant: it was a great experience
Ellie: thats_good (that's good)
Ellie: easy_sleep (how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep)
Participant: um
Participant: it all depends if i exercise regularly and i don't eat too late
Participant: and things are going well in my life i generally sleep pretty well
Participant: even though i might have to get up and go to the bathroom once during the night um
Participant: but i generally sleep uh
Participant: i generally sleep pretty well
Ellie: feel_lately (how have you been feeling lately)
Participant: i feel pretty good lately
Participant: you know i've been like anybody else more periods of blue in your life but
Participant: boy the last few months i feel great pretty much
Ellie: behavior_changes (have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately)
Participant: no not really
Participant: i seem i think i seem a little happier more content lately
Ellie: okay_confirm (okay)
Ellie: depression_diagnosed (have you been diagnosed with depression)
Participant: um i've had thought maybe in the past because i do have a family history of it
Participant: and
Participant: you know
Participant: it wasn't
Participant: anything real too debilitating
Participant: and i wasn't able to really function
Participant: on my own but i was concerned with it and sought counseling
Ellie: therapy_useful (do you feel like therapy is useful)
Participant: i do i was really against it in the past
Participant: and until after i went i mean i wish i went more say during my uh
Participant: my marriage over the course of uh my life now i think it's very useful however in the past
Participant: i was one of those i grew up hearing that it was just ridiculous
Participant: and it was a waste of money etcetera but i think it's a useful tool if you're open to it
Ellie: why_seek_help (what got you to seek help)
Participant: oh just some questions i wanted just an honest opinion outside of friends or strangers from a professional you know about
Participant: life relationships
Participant: and sometimes it's good talking things out with a
Participant: a professional even though i wouldn't see someone like you in real life i prefer someone who's older than i am a little more life experience than someone who's maybe younger
Ellie: understand (i understand)
Participant: so but yeah i think it's a useful tool and
Participant: i really did a hundred and eighty degree switch on that
Ellie: therapy_going (do you still go to therapy now)
Participant: uh i don't go now i'm sorta taking a break from it but i'm not against it if i have some issues i wanna bounce off
Participant: i do have someone that i go to
Ellie: okay_confirm (okay)
Participant: yeah
Ellie: therapist_affect (how has seeing a therapist affected you)
Participant: i think it's nice
Participant: you know they really
Participant: if you go to someone who's good and again i've been to a few different people and sort of therapist shopped
Participant: they really don't tell you what to think which i think is great you know that's
Participant: always in the past they just help you talk through your
Participant: your thoughts
Participant: and your feelings and let you decide for yourself but bring a little clarity
Ellie: yeah2 (yeah)
Participant: to the situation that's why i like
Participant: talking to someone who has a lot more life experience
Participant: and i generally feel more comfortable talking to a woman about that stuff than say to a man
Ellie: uh_huh (uh huh)
Participant: so but it's
Participant: um
Participant: i think it's a a useful tool i got some good ideas and
Participant: was able to it's nice balancing some things off totally someone who's unbiased and not in your day to day life instead of talking to a a romantic partner or a close friend who knows you
Participant: but sometimes bouncing the people off of strangers is good
Ellie: uh_huh (uh huh)
Ellie: happy_lasttime (tell me about the last time you felt really happy)
Participant: uh this morning
Participant: i know this this is weird but i'm clearly someone and i'd say this as a joke to my friends and
Participant: family and associates i clearly have i'm having an easy day today 'cause i knew we're having nice weather
Participant: and i have a bunch of errands to run
Participant: and i clearly have seasonal affective disorder but i woke up so happy today when i know it's gonna be eighty degrees out
Participant: and when the weather's nice i'm generally a lot more happier than when the weather's [laughter] dark and blue and rainy and cold
Participant: where i always i know that term so
Participant: but i'm just well i woke up really happy today because i knew it's gonna be a nice day
Ellie: thats_great (that's great)
Participant: and i looked forward to feeling the sun
Participant: so
Ellie: BF_describe (how would your best friend describe you)
Participant: uh most of my friends i'm sort of a renaissance man i know a little bit about a lot of subjects
Participant: i'm too smart for my own good
Participant: and i'm a
Participant: i know a a lot a lot of permeable things i'm pretty rational
Participant: i'm very resourceful
Participant: people always call me when they have issues
Participant: and i help talk them through it or i'm resourceful and tell them where to go
Participant: whether it's where to buy a new computer or buy a new car or
Participant: you know i'm great with medical diagnoses
Participant: uh
Participant: and uh
Participant: you know people also say i'm a lot of fun
Ellie: mhm (mhm)
Participant: i'm fun to be with
Participant: and um
Participant: i also have i don't have a lot of grey areas people will either really like me or don't like me with me things are pretty much black and white
Participant: i am what i am
Participant: i don't b_s
Participant: you know
Participant: i'm the opposite of a politician
Participant: so i don't tell people what they want to hear i don't be rude not rude to anybody but i pretty much call things as i see them
Ellie: yeah3 (yeah)
Participant: so that's pretty much
Ellie: landed_trouble (has that gotten you in trouble)
Participant: no not really 'cause i do everything tactfully
Ellie: okay_confirm (okay)
Participant: i like to think i do
Ellie: regret (is there anything you regret)
Participant: uh
Participant: probably just i probably spent more time with my parents before they passed but i was busy
Participant: uh
Participant: i probably wish i was able to spend more time with my daughter when she was younger
Participant: uh
Participant: but just a lot of it's very typical
Ellie: advice_back (what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago)
Participant: really to think things through a little bit more be a little less impulsive
Participant: or have pretended to be more impulsive when i was younger than i am now
Participant: i think that's that's it and i would look at things in the long term instead of looking
Participant: in things in the short term you know when you make decisions or choices
Ellie: Ellie17Dec2012_08 (what are you most proud of in your life)
Participant: um i'm proud of my daughter she's
Participant: a nice young lady i am uh
Participant: proud of my public service i've never done a job really for money of my
Participant: military service and fire service
Participant: um there are very few people like me who did it
Participant: who are as
