Participant: but i do wanna be uh i actually still wanna be a filmmaker and um that's still one of my plans
Participant: and i still actually i got into um playing poker
Participant: a few years ago and i really like
Participant: the idea of becoming
Participant: a full time filmmaker or full time poker player however both of those jobs are
Participant: extremely difficult to make a living out of and you
Participant: have to be like the small percent so we'll see if not then
Participant: hopefully my optician career can take me somewhere
Ellie: change_directions (what made you decide to do that)
Participant: to be an optician
Ellie: yes (yes)
Participant: oh um
Participant: uh i guess i was just trying to find something that it was like it's like a trade it's well it's a private college but
Participant: it just like specifically
Participant: trains you into um
Participant: one field and you just learn that you don't do like your g_e and
Participant: all these other classes like you normally would do for like um
Participant: like a um a major or whatever you're gonna do so it just trains you specifically to be an optician and jump in the field
Participant: i um took it just because i actually want <w> want to be a dental assistant and since <si>
Participant: it sound like something maybe i could do
Participant: it sounds interesting but then the counselor actually
Participant: um got my attention to be an optician so
Participant: i'm now trying to be an optician
Ellie: makes_sense (that makes sense)
Participant: and it's interesting so
Participant: it's fun it's um
Participant: really hard but it's interesting and it
Participant: and it um
Participant: and it's it's fun it has um rewarding
Participant: um
Participant: rewarding benefits as far as like being able to help people see
Participant: better and feel comfortable with
Participant: glasses or contact lenses whatever they feel
Participant: more comfortable with
Ellie: thats_great (that's great)
Participant: cool
Ellie: shyoutgoing (do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing)

Ellie: wild_laughter5 ((laughter))
Participant: or uh animated or whatever <laughter>
Participant: so
Participant: cool
Participant: but no usually ninety eight percent
Ellie: relax_fishtank (sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax)
Participant: <laughter>
Participant: um i actually which it is actually kinda funny and i think maybe
Participant: this might go for some of the poker players too um
Participant: i don't really i've never really talked to any professional poker player but as far as like
Participant: um i actually
Participant: playing poker is um
Participant: actually something that
Participant: helps me forget about anything as far as like um
Participant: stuff in the past or present
Participant: um or future stuff that's coming up uh as far as like i am really relaxed <rela>
Participant: i really um could just not think about anything and just think about poker and it actually it's kinda like a therapy
Participant: thing for me 'cause i don't like i guess you could say it's a kinda drug because um i don't think about anything as far as like stressed out or depressed or stuff that's happened in the past
Participant: i just like focus on poker so it's actually kinda relieving however
Participant: playing poker is very stressful on top of that so i guess it's kind of like um
Participant: catch twenty two or whatever but uh
Ellie: hmm1 (hmm)
Participant: yeah so no poker i play like to play basketball
Participant: i like to watch movies i like to go to the beach actually
Participant: one of the things i like to do is go to the beach 'cause it does
Participant: um it makes me feel good
Participant: but it i didn't go
Participant: i usually only go to the beach when it's hot not during the
Participant: cold season
Participant: so it's coming up soon so i'm looking forward to that i'm gonna be busy but uh i'll try to go out to the beach as much as i can <laughter>
Ellie: okay_confirm (okay)
Ellie: control_temper (how are you at controlling your temper)
Participant: um i'm really good at controlling my temper actually i've only been in like
Participant: i'm thirty years old i've been in like six fights maybe and
Participant: all six of 'em were started by the other person
Participant: so i've never started a real fight in my whole life like i started fights when i was a little kid but
Participant: talking about like real stuff like once you get passed it at like
Participant: thirteen fourteen <sniffle> uh but yeah no i'm good like every now and then like there's been
Participant: a couple times maybe in the past where like i
Participant: wasn't able to control it
Participant: but um as far as like ever being violent or anything that's never occured and never would
Participant: but for um
Participant: majority of the time yeah i don't have like
Participant: people do stupid things all the time and i just like let it go especially like um
Participant: on the freeway and stuff but uh
Ellie: last_argument (when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about)
Participant: oh well i mean i argued a bit with my ex girlfriend a lot but uh it was just about really
Participant: um petty things i guess that maybe we just
Participant: i think we were good for each other but uh maybe some other lifetime because uh
Participant: we just bumped heads too much so
Participant: obviously she's my ex girlfriend probably for a reason so
Ellie: mm (mm)
Participant: we just argued about
Participant: girlfriend boyfriend things
Ellie: situation_handled (tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently)
Participant: uh
Participant: um
Participant: i guess my filmmaking <filmm> um
Participant: handled differently
Participant: there's a lot of stuff i could've handled differently but uh
Participant: uh maybe like when i was doing really good when i was younger and
Participant: i was um working for
Participant: scrubbed_entry
Participant: production assistant for filmmakers around
Participant: um where i lived in sacramento so i was doing everything that i wanted to do as far as my dreams are concerned
Participant: and had a lot all my stuff together i had my own car my own apartment
Participant: and then i got involved with like uh the wrong
Participant: group of people i guess and
Participant: kinda tumbled downhill from there and like lost everything like car job apartment
Participant: so i just wish that maybe i never got involved with
Participant: those kind of people that kinda of girl
Participant: um uh
Participant: ever
Participant: uh because <clears throat> i woulda
Participant: probably it probably my life probably would be a lot different now however i believe that everything happens for a reason
Participant: and obviously i think you should also like if stuff happens good or bad uh
Participant: <sigh> uh learn from your other mistakes so that when it happens again you could um
Participant: not make that mistake or try not to make it as bad i guess so
Ellie: yeah_downer (yeah)
Participant: you know
Ellie: hard_decisionB (tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make)
Participant: mm
Participant: hardest decision i guess
Participant: i guess uh hardest decision
Participant: the hardest decision i have ever had to make
Participant: would be um
Participant: i guess you could say uh i don't really know
Participant: was gonna say that uh
Participant: maybe like my ex girlfriend like i could've like
Participant: stayed with her and i really like still am in love with her and uh
Participant: would like to be with her and miss her
Participant: but i guess the biggest mistake <mis> um decision that i had to make was like
Participant: i know that it wasn't like a healthy relationship and
Participant: i know if we like stayed together or if we got married or had kids that
Participant: i don't think it would end up working out anyways so
Participant: i guess the decision my hardest decision would be
Participant: to like actually stay away from her and not get back with her
Participant: and uh
Participant: be uh not with her so
Participant: i guess that was a hard really hard decision because um
Participant: i could easily have done it and i guess maybe i would've been
Participant: happier in that way but stressed out and
Participant: um irritable or whatever and the other way of having to deal with her i guess deal with each other our our relationship so
Participant: it was really hard still is so uh i guess that's it
Participant: not choosing to be with someone that i i loved and loved me
Participant: or whatever so
Ellie: mm (mm)
Participant: cool
Ellie: memory_erase (tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory)

Participant: like high school and different part times of out of high school i would've just
Participant: really focused on um schooling and stuff and then

Participant: uh have more direction be more focused i guess uh
Participant: stay away from people and unhealthy relationships unhealthy people i guess not that i'm the healthiest but <sniffle> um yeah i just would've done a lot of stuff different but
