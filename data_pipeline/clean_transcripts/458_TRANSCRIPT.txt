Participant: um probably when
Participant: i used to travel with my dad that's where i got a lot of my traveling from
Participant: um yeah it was bus car sometimes planes uh mostly what just i guess i'll say mostly down south but it was
Participant: really fun
Participant: especially the road trips
Participant: mhm
Participant: um just general and also drama
Participant: uh well my dream job is
Participant: to become a real estate investor
Participant: um well i've sort of really been into it ever since two thousand five um i just don't have the capital right now or the connections that um
Participant: since i do like real estate i'm just going to start off as a real estate agent
Participant: so i should have my license um sometime this year
Participant: outgoing
Participant: um well i'm not shy um it could be a little bit of both but um i'm pretty outgoing
Participant: um well speaking of hawaii i did uh live there for a year and a half but what do i do to relax is either um usually take a nap <laughter>
Participant: um take a bath
Participant: um or just try to get things off of my mind and try to spend my energy in more positive ways
Participant: um it needs to be worked on but um
Participant: i know when to control it
Participant: um when i need to
Participant: um
Participant: well me and my ex-husband still get into arguments um it was just over a text message but
Participant: um actually it was my fault but um usually it's his but it just starts little and kind of snowballs out of control but
Participant: um that's usually how it goes <laughter>
Participant: um
Participant: well
Participant: i xxx don't know what else to do except for pray on it because i thought once i moved into another house it would be over but i see that we're still getting into it
Participant: so um i don't know maybe ignore it or if he wants to be right then let him be right i guess
Participant: um
Participant: probably quite a few things but i don't regret anything i've done in my life but um
Participant: situation i wish i would've handled differently um just
Participant: kind of everything in my life almost <laughter> i could've done it differently or i would if i had the chance but i'm not worried about it 'cause i don't regret anything that i've done in my life
Participant: the hardest decision um probably when i had to get a divorce that
Participant: mm that may have been the hardest or one of the hardest decisions
Participant: um it was just a lot of um
Participant: a lot of stuff through the years um <clears throat> the relationship had kind of deteriorated um
Participant: if the relationship
Participant: between us was still good
Participant: then the things that he were doing um
Participant: i would have been able to overlook it a little bit more because um i've i would feel like well our relationship is good and
Participant: it's difficult to find a really really good relationship but since our relationship deteriorated and there's just a lot of disagreement and arguing and
Participant: problems financial problems and he's doing this so um
Participant: i just decided just forget it i mean i tried but
Participant: eh you know he didn't wanna cooperate so
Participant: um
Participant: well i'm happy with what's going on now i mean i wish that we could still be a family but since that's not going to happen yes i am happy with my life right now yes
Participant: um
Participant: something i can erase um
Participant: mm i don't think i really need to erase anything um
Participant: i've finally gotten over the way the kids treated me at school but other than that i can't think of anything to erase
Participant: um it's fair slash good um there's no problems right now so i guess i'll just say good yeah there's no problems
Participant: um well i would have to say my mother
Participant: yes
Participant: um well she's just always supported me and
Participant: everything that i've done um whether it's
Participant: good or not so good so um i think that's a blessing
Participant: mhm
Participant: um sometimes sometime it's not
Participant: um well i just don't get enough hours of sleep i guess that's what it is as i would like to um sometimes
Participant: so um that's more the problem i would like to get
Participant: mhm
Participant: um just sleepy <sigh> yeah sleepy tired feeling like i wanna go take a nap
Participant: um i've been feeling fine
Participant: mhm
Participant: uh no they've been about the same
Participant: no
Participant: no
Participant: um really happy uh probably last week because i got over to a little bit of money so <laughter>
Participant: um well i guess my best friend would be my mom or maybe my um entertainment friend that i've been knowing since ninety six
Participant: i really wouldn't
Participant: i'm not gonna say i don't consider him a best friend but we don't really hang out that much but he is very um generous to me and my mom
Participant: mhm
Participant: so
Participant: um
Participant: well right now i spend my weekends doing chores and classwork and sleeping in
Participant: but maybe after the classwork is out of the way um <laughter> maybe i can do something else
Participant: uh myself well i do wish that um
Participant: at times i could control my temper a little more and um of course i would like to lose weight
Participant: um be a little bit more active and um i wish my skin would clear up
Participant: um it was probably when i was in school um school years are terrible for a lot of people because the kids are animals
Participant: so um they try to make you feel like um you're nothing like you're
Participant: piece of dirt under their foot so that's probably the last time as an adult no
Participant: um i would say that i'm genuine um i'm honest um i'm supportive
Participant: and um i'm just a good friend
Participant: no
Participant: um well uh twenty years ago um
Participant: just because you're pregnant that doesn't mean that you're eating for two and you can eat loads of food like um people tell you
Participant: <laughter> um that's the main thing um i'm going to tell my daughters no
Participant: um just eat as you normally eat but eat more healthier um there's no need to gain eighty pounds when
Participant: the baby is just twenty pounds or less and you have all this weight to lose
Participant: um also if i came into any money now twenty years ago i was probably just thinking about shopping or um
Participant: just kind of spending it on frivolous stuff whereas now i would um invest it
Participant: um so yeah i think that's about it <laughter>
Participant: um proud of uh <sigh>
Participant: mm i guess maybe myself um
Participant: my kids
Participant: k thank you
Participant: bye
