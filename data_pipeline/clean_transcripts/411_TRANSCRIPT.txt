Ellie: memorableB (what's one of your most memorable experiences)
Participant: in kenya um
Participant: probably when i went to a
Participant: a masai village and i happened to i used to live in hawaii
Participant: and i've had been to tahiti and i was wearing one of those pareos that are hand painted and i had it
Participant: tied over the left shoulder with the twisted in a knot and i happened to
Participant: enter a masai village for the first time
Participant: uh that day and i looked all around and the men were wearing their clothing exactly with the same
Participant: twist <laughter> on the same shoulder and they came over to me and they said why are you dressed masai
Ellie: wild_laughter5 ((laughter))
Ellie: wild_laughter3 ((laughter))
Participant: and uh <laughter> and um then they came back and gave me what appeared to be
Participant: uh
Participant: some very large what looked like beaded leather bookmarks but they were actually earrings so they would've like weighed
Participant: my ears straight down and um and then then they gave me some bracelets
Participant: and then they had uh me wear something around my waist and they said now you look proper masai <laughter> so but i i yeah i just i have a lot of uh i think living
Ellie: aw (aw)
Participant: getting a chance to live in different countries around the world i've just uh you feel alive all your senses are completely you know uh awoken yeah
Ellie: thats_great (that's great)
Ellie: shyoutgoing (do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing)
Participant: <sigh>
Participant: i think it's not so clear cut i think a lot of peoples are a hybrid of both i mean i think i can be extremely shy sometimes but extremely brazen
Participant: uh and very courageous at other times probably one of my best virtues is i'm very gutsy person so when i really feel passionate about something i risk everything to go
Participant: achieve it sometimes um i believe that
Participant: um
Participant: usually i well i make decisions very quickly
Participant: and i find that i have a friend who makes decisions very slowly and he said to me tell me how i can make decisions quicker
Participant: and i told him i said well in each case
Participant: you always have no choice and he says what do you mean there's
Participant: hundreds of choices and i said not really because it's gut wise is only one
Participant: and it doesn't really matter you waste time physical energy emotional energy
Participant: mental energy reflecting all of it when gut wise you always know what the choice what you really wanna do is and it doesn't matter whether there's a ninety eight percent chance of failure
Participant: even if it's a two percent chance of success you have to go to the one that may yield you joy so i always go to that it's it's to me a waste of total time
Participant: and energy to even think about another choice 'cause who cares if you remain unscathed but it when it yields no joy
Ellie: yeah2 (yeah)
Ellie: yeah3 (yeah)
Ellie: see_mean (i see what you mean)
Ellie: relax_fishtank (sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax)
Participant: uh pardon
Participant: you said you put your fish
Ellie: what_do_when_annoyed (what do you do when you are annoyed)
Participant: what do i do when i'm annoyed
Ellie: yes (yes)
Participant: um <sigh>
Participant: <tisk> i think when i'm annoyed sometimes i it's because sometimes i can have i can need to be a little more patient um
Participant: i guess you really have to put yourself
Participant: in somebody else's shoes rather than the way you would react you have to have more empathy
Ellie: difficult (how hard is that)
Participant: um not really i think that's the reason why i enjoy traveling so much 'cause you're
Participant: put in other situations where you're forced to
Participant: to um
Participant: understand other people's
Participant: lives a lot more regardless of how different they are
Participant: uh from yours different situations i've been to so many third world countries and and lived in so many different situations that you <y> it it helps create that which is why
Participant: travel is really the best education there is
Ellie: yeah3 (yeah)
Ellie: last_argument (when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about)
Participant: <sigh> let me think um
Participant: <tisk> uh <sigh>
Participant: last time i argued about
Participant: something um
Participant: god i'm trying to remember <laughter> um
Participant: oh i think it was when somebody didn't respect actually my privacy in something
Ellie: tell_about_that (can you tell me about that)
Participant: um
Participant: uh <sigh>
Participant: oh i know what it was um
Participant: it was somebody who belonged to the uh
Participant: uh scientology faith um
Participant: i uh
Participant: inherited
Participant: i inherited um possibly uh a immune disorder from my mother my mother died from lupus
Participant: and um
Participant: uh i sometimes even right now i have like skin rashes welts and everything and i am very photo sensitive
Participant: and um
Participant: <tisk> i had an you know an episode where i was i had big flare up and i wasn't really feeling well i felt flushed and everything and the scientologist tells me that i needed to be audited
Participant: and um
Participant: and he said something about are you aware of
Participant: past lives and
Participant: i had told him that i was buddhist and i was kind of curious that
Participant: if you're going to try to recruit somebody to convert to your religion at least you should find out the other person what religion they are just to even be informed and to be able to talk to them
Ellie: yeah2 (yeah)
Participant: and i and he said that are you aware that
Participant: um
Participant: <tisk> about something in your past and i go yes i believe that
Participant: many religions uh including buddhisms and scientology believe that things that you have <ha> have
Participant: had in your history sometimes affect you or things that you keep that anger issues bitterness
Participant: um resulting from even your past relationships or your
Participant: parents and such can affect and make you even sick make you even have cancer yes we believe that and also <a> we also believe i said that
Participant: you know that you have the power of each person has a god like or a buddha like nature to go ahead and you can make yourself
Participant: even when i'm on the verge of possibly being i probably get one cold
Participant: maybe every fifteen years i don't have a tendency to be sick at all
Participant: and a large part of it is i think when i think i'm on the verge
Participant: i take
Participant: sort of like and i did this even when i was a child uh when i was seven i would
Participant: fold down i had my boo boo
Participant: and i would take <ta> i would say i would have the good part
Participant: you know help the bad part <laughter> from a simplistic way in terms of a child
Ellie: right2 (right)
Participant: and i would actually
Participant: even when i was in a very severe car accident where i got cut by glass my whole back
Participant: i concentrated healing and and when i went back to the hospital
Participant: the doctors actually had the nurses come and say this is incredible that
Participant: just <jj> her last week her back was so severely cut this is incredible healing thing so i believe that but uh
Participant: um
Participant: uh but i was just i think annoyed and irritated a little because the scientologist told me that
Participant: because he had taken twenty or forty courses and he these certificates on his wall that he felt that he was more enlightened and
Participant: it didn't <did> it wasn't even a matter i said of whether he was
Participant: um whether he took twenty forty courses or whether i'd been practicing buddhism whether it was for five ten fifteen
Participant: twenty years or whether somebody'd been practicing some type of christianity for fifty years and bending sitting in a church pew every day it doesn't mean this person could have
Participant: never attended church and be more spiritual than somebody who has
Ellie: yeah2 (yeah)
Participant: you know
Participant: so i just was thinking that was the antithesis of
Participant: somebody who says they're enlightened but it's just the way i guess he kept cramming his
Participant: uh
Participant: you know his faith down my throat that after a while i was pretty patient with him but he it was so pompous that i became irritated
Ellie: yeah3 (yeah)
Participant: especially when he kept telling me that it was audited and yet the same person needed a hip surgery
Ellie: understand (i understand)
Participant: uh the following week
Participant: and i didn't point it out to him 'cause i just didn't wanna get
Participant: into it but
Participant: one could say hey you have a bad hip 'cause you need to be audited that that something that you did in your past otherwise you wouldn't need to get a hip surgery i mean i believe to some extent things that can be caused
Participant: by people themselves
Participant: and then he's flippantly said well are you aware of scientologists believe that
Participant: past lives can also affect
Participant: you know and i'm thinking to myself buddhists of all religions are
Participant: are kind of like well known for you know believing in in a cause and effect and past lives situations and i found my thought
Participant: he should really read up if he's trying to convert other people <laughter> from other religions so
Participant: but um
Participant: <tisk> you know i i you know i i just didn't
Participant: you know care for the fact that he wouldn't drop it <laughter>
Ellie: yeah3 (yeah)
Participant: but other than that i mean i don't
Ellie: situation_handled (tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently)
Participant: <sigh> um
Participant: uh <sigh>
Participant: sometimes to have a little more tact i guess when
Participant: when it's in terms of patience
Ellie: mm (mm)
Ellie: hard_decisionB (tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make)
Participant: i can think of that right away i guess uh disconnecting my father when he was like a vegetable in the hospital
Ellie: im_sorry (i'm sorry)
Ellie: hard_decision (how did you decide to do that)
Participant: mm <sigh>
Participant: mm my brother
Participant: uh was supposed to be the strong one supposedly because he
Participant: is in the medical field so my sister and i said well
Participant: you know he's the medical one so he's probably used to seeing this all the time
Participant: but it turns out he was the weakest one and even after
Participant: you know my boss my father kept
Participant: you know um
Participant: um you know bucking the his body would actually
Participant: be fighting the artificial respirator and all kinds of things you see all this jerking of body movements and stuff it was just very hard
Participant: mm but you know it was after a while the uh
Participant: you know even the physicians and even the uh pastor from that particular
Participant: uh hospital <ho> you know hospital they said that he was no longer like even if he was to awaken from that he his brain function would've been <b> been you know negligible
Ellie: yeah_downer (yeah)
Ellie: been_hard (that sounds really hard)
Participant: yeah it was mhm
Ellie: memory_erase (tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory)
Participant: hm
Participant: mm
Participant: i don't think i really have that many things that are that traumatic
Participant: that happened to me that i've
Participant: had to block them i really don't know what
Participant: it is within my makeup which
Participant: doesn't make me feel like i need to like i don't keep i have friends that
Participant: have unmitigated issues which they're not even aware of
Participant: that affect their behavior or maybe their bitterness or their anger or their hatred or their fear
Participant: and for some reason i i feel blessed that i
Participant: don't really i can't really even think of something that
Participant: i mean i've had some
Participant: bad situations happen to me but
Participant: it's not that the some reason they've traumatized me
Participant: in affecting
Participant: you know my behavior where i would
Participant: where i block it that i'm not aware
Participant: of something or i hold residual
Participant: negativity for some reason so
Participant: i really can't think of anything i mean
Participant: there's bad things that happen and i know they're there but it's not like i feel like i it's necessary for me to
Participant: block them 'cause i've been able to
Participant: you know um
Participant: accept sometimes <so> sometimes there were unfortunate things that happened
Ellie: okay_confirm (okay)
Ellie: easy_sleep (how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep)
Participant: pretty easy i can usually make my sleep i self sleep in any situation if i have a one hour flight to san francisco i could just
Participant: kind of lean against the window with the pillow have the blanket over and even on an hour flight pass out before the plane has even taken off from the ground so
Participant: i can just <j> i have literally when i've had little sleep and i very uh high energy so i don't really need that much sleep but
Participant: say like if i'm in africa and i
Participant: <tisk> bumpy potholed unpaved road and i suddenly saw that i need a few moments of sleep i'll just prop something up put my
Participant: elbow against the window and say i think i'll gonna take a nap for <laughter> fifteen minutes go like this and through the jostling i coud just take a nap for fifteen minutes so i don't really have <ha> have that problem
Ellie: wild_laughter5 ((laughter))
Ellie: thats_good (that's good)
Ellie: feel_lately (how have you been feeling lately)
Participant: okay pretty okay i mean i could deal without the skin flare ups but you know from the photo sensitivity and all that but other than that i'm in pretty good spirts uh huh

Participant: regret about my entire life you mean or are you talking about just recently or what are you talking about
Ellie: mind (whatever comes to your mind)
Participant: mm
Participant: you know it's funny
Participant: uh i find that a lot of the negative experiences that in in my life that have happened have also been
Participant: uh
Participant: um
Participant: opened up experiences that are
Participant: that are also great that i have not
Participant: overlooked for example i got totally ripped off by my business partner
Participant: to the tune of my whole <wh> my whole savings and i've had to start all over again and
Participant: sometimes people sat to me like
Participant: are you sure you're okay are you are you just pretending to be okay or
Participant: are you angry do you wanna seek revenge if i was
Participant: you know 'cause my business partner essentially ripped me off we knew each other's families which was even
Participant: more difficult in a way um and uh
Participant: he stole essentially my whole life's savings essentially in a way and he was <w> got sent to prison and the f_b_i was involved interpol was involved
Participant: uh i was living in switzerland and my father was sick and i was going back and forth and um
Participant: <tisk> uh but you know if i hadn't get involved hadn't <ha> hadn't gotten involved with him in business
Participant: i wouldn't have had the a lot of rich experiences and i think sometimes the reason why
Participant: i don't know why i'm such a positive person but for some reason uh i'm able to it's not that i'm purposely trying to i do see
Participant: the positiveness in even horrible situations i wouldn't have gotten
Participant: to live in barcelona and zurich i wouldn't have learned to speak as good spanish german <g>
Participant: german
Participant: uh lived in in europe if i had not gotten involved in business with my business partner who ended up ripping me off
Participant: but and there's a lot of other experiences and different friendships that i developed
Participant: during that period of time and in a way it was a total different life
Participant: uh
Participant: a different world that
Participant: that would you know that i would've never
Participant: um had the chance
Participant: you know to
Participant: live through if i had not involved my
Participant: you know but of course it cost me financially and but then again i've always been the type of person who
Participant: you know money isn't everything and
Participant: i think the when i least cared about money is when i made the most of it so
Participant: there you go
Ellie: yeah3 (yeah)
Participant: <laughter> and for example one of my favorite
Participant: times in my life probably when i lived in kenya
Participant: and you would think that
Participant: you know a lot of people have this
Participant: really bad vision of it maybe looking living
Participant: in mud dung huts or something and living very primitively i mean it it's not like that at all but i and you'd think that with the least amount of
Participant: uh technological <tech> technological innovations and stuff like that i mean actually and i really didn't have
Participant: you know that much many <m> many material goods at the time i mean i had the blast i had probably the one of the best
Participant: years of my life when i was living in kenya
Ellie: mm (mm)
Ellie: good_hear (that's so good to hear)
Ellie: advice_back (what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago)
Participant: the same thing that i did probably when i was about fifteen or sixteen
Participant: um
Participant: to
Participant: live your life with passion
Participant: and again like choose the way i was saying earlier about
Participant: making decisions
Participant: you have to make those decisions gut wise
Participant: what will
Participant: give you a sense of awe and wonderment what would make you give you joy
Participant: and you have to it's it's regardless what the percentages are even if you only have a one percent chance of success you have to go towards that 'cause that's the only thing that will yield
Participant: you know the happiness in your life
Ellie: mhm (mhm)
Ellie: Ellie17Dec2012_08 (what are you most proud of in your life)
Participant: <tisk> the fact that i've adhered to that and been brazen whatever you wanna say have the balls the chutzpah the cojones to go ahead and
Participant: follow my
Participant: passions and
Participant: you know and i guess people call them sometimes strong decisions usually
Participant: decisions that are easy <ea> when you where you remain unscathed usually don't yield joy that's just murphy's law that's just the way it is
Ellie: yeah2 (yeah)
Ellie: asked_everything (okay i think i have asked everything i need to)
Ellie: appreciate_open (thanks for sharing your thoughts with me)
