Participant: um a lot better i've been doing a lot of yoga and meditation um kinda seeing things from a different per view or another <ano> not per <pe> per view but a different view and um
Participant: that's helped but there's definitely times where i kind of sink back into thinking about the event especially because the event caused me to stop working
Ellie: are they triggered by something
Participant: um
Participant: i think i you know i have a difficulty being in public um i'm still dealing with anxiety and paranoia about that and that something may happen so
Participant: um so a lot of times during the day is when it happened so i'm not that comfortable going out during the day i tend to go out in the mornings and evenings

Ellie: how do you cope with them
Participant: um
Participant: well i've been gradually trying to increase how much i'm outside um
Participant: and i usually just deep breathing um i do a lot of breathing exercises and
Participant: i just try to say that basically what i'm thinking or what's going on with me is not real um and that
Participant: i just i try <laughter> i just try to get myself to go into these places more gradually a lot better since uh the last couple months but before i very much pretty much stayed home
Ellie: okay
Ellie: how has seeing a therapist affected you
