Ellie: situation_handled (tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently)
Participant: um <sigh> <tisk> when i was younger i wish that uh i didn't follow some of the people that i followed

Participant: that's what got me into trouble <sniff> i was an only child and uh
Participant: i kind of enjoyed being the center of attention and um
Participant: getting the girls to laugh or having people mm think i was you know cool or whatever you wouldn't think that now i'm kinda overweight and balding but
Participant: when i was in my twenties i was a a completely different person and
Participant: <sniff>

Participant: uh
Participant: again i'm not trying to bring up my uncle just because of what has happened but he used to constantly tell me to uh

Participant: um the young lady that i was talking to in here they think
Participant: they're invincible and so did i <laughter> i figured ah i'm never gonna i'm never gonna have those problems
Participant: um
Participant: i wish i could've changed some things um
Participant: <coughs> the history of my past follows me as it does everybody
Participant: and that has limited me in in a lot of opportunities and a lot of things that i'm able to do
Participant: uh i don't miss them but
Participant: if i could go back uh ten or twenty years i definitely wouldn't make some of the decisions that i made
Ellie: Ellie17Dec2012_08 (what are you most proud of in your life)

Participant: restoration and working on vehicles and i don't see it but
Participant: i've been told that
Participant: once or twice but i i've kind of
Participant: i i've kind of started to slip away from that i don't i can't say it's from lack of interest but
