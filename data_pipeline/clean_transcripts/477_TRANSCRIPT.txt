Participant: oklahoma's very different um
Participant: uh l_a's a lot more exciting
Participant: there's a lot more um
Participant: uh to do here and um
Participant: uh the ocean obviously is very nice so
Ellie: mhm (mhm)
Ellie: why_LA (why did you move to l_a)
Participant: um
Participant: you know that's a good question i um
Participant: i wanted to try something new and i've always loved the beach and

Ellie: happy_didthat (are you happy you did that)
Participant: very it's probably one of the best uh decisions i ever made
Ellie: good_hear (that's so good to hear)
Participant: <laughter>

Participant: it seemed like a good fit
Participant: um i just really like it here
Ellie: living_situation (how do you like your living situation)
Participant: oh it's great um i have a couple of roommates and we get along really well i live a couple of blocks from the beach
Participant: um and uh every day i get to walk on the beach or
Participant: um you know hang out with friends and it's just it's kind of like being on vacation all the time it's really nice
Ellie: awesome (awesome)
Ellie: study (what did you study at school)
Participant: mm
Participant: i studied philosophy and um political theory and government
Participant: and did a little bit of english literature on the side
Ellie: hard_decision (how did you decide to do that)
Participant: um it
Participant: kind of just happened naturally i think uh
Participant: i went to liberal arts school and got kind of a exposure to a lot of different
Participant: areas and
Participant: i just followed what i liked and was interested in and ended up spending a lot of time studying that
Ellie: still_working_on_X (are you still working in that)
Participant: um
Participant: not exactly i work for an educational nonprofit so i work with graduate <grad> with graduate students um in the social sciences and humanities
Ellie: mhm (mhm)
Participant: um but i don't actually um use my philosophy background very often
Ellie: dream_job (what's your dream job)
Participant: <laughter> um
Participant: you know i have actually studied to become a success coach
Participant: um and so i working with students is is kind of a nice
Participant: aspect of of doing that but i'd really like to work with other <o> with other people so not just students
Participant: um but help them to achieve their goals and realize their dreams
Ellie: difficult (how hard is that)
Participant: um i'd say it it it's fairly hard um in the sense that
Participant: um
Participant: you know it can be challenging for people to actually
Participant: be motivated and do all of the work that needs to be um
Participant: undertaken in order to realize their their dreams but and it it's also a challenge because making a living at it
Participant: uh requires charging people money <laughter> so um finding people who are willing to pay for that can be um difficult too
Ellie: yeah_downer (yeah)
Ellie: shyoutgoing (do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing)
Participant: um i'm definitely on the shyer side i'm an introvert so
Ellie: why2 (why)
Participant: um i'm pretty good in one on one situations with people but when you get me in a group with more than a a couple of people
Participant: i'm very much an observer so i tend to listen a lot and i'm not as engaged
Participant: and i think that um is
Participant: something that goes it is noticed by others and it it maybe is a little bit odd to them especially if they're not introverted
Participant: um so i i'd say and it's also a challenge for me i tend not to be the person who introduces myself um in a room full of strangers
Ellie: okay_confirm (okay)
Ellie: control_temper (how are you at controlling your temper)
Participant: <laughter> pretty good i think
Participant: um but i do have a temper so i can get i can get upset from time to time
Ellie: landed_trouble (has that gotten you in trouble)
Participant: not really um it can be a challenge when i'm driving <laughter> but other than that no
Ellie: last_argument (when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about)
Participant: hmm
Participant: hmm
Participant: i'm not sure
Participant: it would've probably been a discussion over politics
Participant: and it probably would've been a friendly argument
Participant: um
Participant: probably with one of my liberal friends so
Participant: but i actually can't remember the specific time
Ellie: mm (mm)
Ellie: okay_confirm (okay)
Ellie: relax_fishtank (sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax)

Ellie: situation_handled (tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently)

Participant: <sigh>
Participant: hmm
Ellie: back_later (let's come back to that later)
Participant: okay i'm sorry <laughter>
Ellie: memory_erase (tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory)
Participant: hmm
Participant: well this isn't exactly an event it's it's a dream and it's not a particularly
Participant: um traumatic dream so as far as dreams go but
Participant: um i do have it sometimes
Participant: probably more often than i'd like so i wouldn't be upset if it
Participant: you know if i didn't have it
Participant: um and it's just a version of a dream that i think a lot of people probably have but um
Participant: it's usually me in school somewhere
Participant: at the end of the semester
Participant: haven't gone to class taking the exams know i'm going to fail
Participant: and
Participant: you know really unhappy about it wishing why didn't i
Participant: study and attend class the way i should have
Participant: um which actually wasn't really a problem for me in school but now i have this dream sometimes and it's kinda frustrating
Participant: and i'm not exactly sure
Participant: why i mean i know why but i don't know what it applies to because it's not like i am worried consciously at least about failing things so
Ellie: mhm (mhm)
Ellie: trigger (are they triggered by something)
Participant: no i don't think so
Participant: um at least not not that i'm aware of
Ellie: okay_confirm (okay)

Participant: i when i used to live there when he was younger
Participant: um spent a lot of time with them and
Participant: since i've been in california and particularly in the last year i've spent a lot less time visiting them so
Participant: for example i saw them for a week at christmas and then i went back
Participant: in <i> at the beginning of may so it was you know four months between the last <la> the last time i'd seen them
Participant: um and that i felt bad about because
Participant: we really enjoy each other's company and he
Participant: um you know really likes me to be there but then he gets upset when i leave and he asks when am i coming back
Participant: so that's um
Participant: that makes me feel bad sometimes
Ellie: understand (i understand)
Ellie: family_relationship (tell me about your relationship with your family)
Participant: mm
Participant: um
Participant: well i have a brother i'm very close to him
Participant: he's younger
Participant: and
Participant: um he's like four four and a half years younger
Participant: he's married um i have a nephew
Participant: um my both of my parents have passed away
Participant: so it's just the two of us and we have a large extended family but we're not that close with them um with most of them
Participant: um
Participant: on my father's side there's one brother
Participant: um and he's married and has a few kids so i have a few cousins on that side but then on my mother's side there are
Participant: <sigh> five <fi> four or five other kids um
Participant: most of them with several children of their own so i have a lot of cousins on that side but they live all over the country and um
Participant: so we stay in touch a little bit through facebook um and there a couple that i talk to on the phone and visit every now and then
Participant: but you know we're not that close with our extended family so
Ellie: okay_confirm (okay)
Ellie: influence_positive (who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life)
Participant: um
Participant: i'd say well
Participant: um i i mean i have a lot of friends i think that have been positive influences
Participant: scrubbed_entry
Participant: when i came out to california
Participant: um
Participant: i started working at a nonprofit and it was kind of a strange place it was very different from what i was used to um
Participant: it was a little bit challenging and she also worked there so
Participant: um we worked on a program together over the summer and got to know one another and
Participant: um we just established this really strong friendship and
Participant: she's kind of i would say my best friend probably here and probably just in general um and now she's moved to vegas um which is a little bit tough for me um
Participant: but uh we're going to napa this weekend so that should be good um but she's been a very she was a very positive influence because when i came out here and didn't really know anybody um
Participant: and it you know since i'm an introvert it's not that easy for me to make friends it was really nice because we share a lot of the same values and we have a lot of fun together and you know
Participant: i think she kinda gets me so it's a lot of fun to hang out with her and and that's been nice
Ellie: good_hear (that's so good to hear)
Ellie: easy_sleep (how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep)
Participant: i'm a sleeper <laughter> so it's pretty easy um
Participant: sometimes my you know
Participant: depending on how long i've been awake <clears throat> i can be wound <wou> a little wound up and so sometimes i have to take a little while to decompress but
Participant: um i usually meditate right before i go to bed um and that's very helpful
Participant: um and i can sleep
Participant: uh
Participant: you know i i i generally sleep in ninety minute cycles
Participant: so
Participant: um you know usually six or seven and a half hours but i can easily sleep nine hours if i have the time and inclination
Participant: um i usually don't wake up in the middle of the night
Participant: or at least if i do i don't remember it
Participant: so
Ellie: uh_huh (uh huh)
Ellie: sleep_affects (what are you like when you don't sleep well)
Participant: um well i don't <do> actually don't sleep very well when i travel <s> one of the things i do for work is i travel uh quite a bit
Participant: because i work for a company that's back east so i work from home
Participant: most of the time but then i travel
Participant: like one week a month
Participant: and when i travel i'll take the red-eye
Participant: um and then i'll visit with a lot of friends in the evening so i don't sleep that much it's not that i
Participant: um sleep
Participant: poorly or badly it's just that i um don't have that much time to sleep
Participant: and the first day
Participant: after not sleeping or not sleeping much is okay
Participant: but usually the second day is not very good
Participant: um so i get a lot more tired uh and it's harder to concentrate
Participant: and um
Participant: i don't know it just feels like more of a struggle
Ellie: okay_confirm (okay)
Ellie: feel_lately (how have you been feeling lately)

Participant: um
Participant: summer is a little <l> is an is a busy time for the organization that i work for so i'm a little

Participant: um everything going well this summer but um in general i'm feeling pretty good
Ellie: behavior_changes (have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately)
Participant: not really i can't i can't think of anything um
Participant: there <th> there is one thing i um i do struggle with exercise like i like to walk a lot um
Participant: and i hike with friends and
Participant: um i had been really motivated about it um for a couple of months but then i went away um to the east coast and when i came back i was a lot less motivated
Participant: um because i didn't really exercise when i was there
Participant: and i'd gotten out of the habit even though it had only been about ten days and so now i'm struggling to try and get back in the routine and it's not going as well as i would like
Ellie: im_sorry (i'm sorry)

Participant: we're actually doing a book club now so we're gonna skype and
Participant: um maybe i'll get some more time with him that way but uh just being around him is fun
Ellie: BF_describe (how would your best friend describe you)
Participant: hmm
Participant: <sigh>
Participant: well she'd probably say that i know how to have fun
Participant: but that i can be serious
Participant: and um
Participant: that i you know care about others
Participant: uh
Participant: and that i'm loyal
Participant: and
Participant: i'm not sure what else
Participant: um
Participant: i think those those are probably the main things
Ellie: okay_confirm (okay)
Ellie: self_change (what are some things you wish you could change about yourself)
Participant: <sniffle>
Participant: um i wish i had more self-discipline <laughter> so
Participant: um
Participant: i wish that you know i could diet um or eat healthier foods and not have a problem
Participant: uh with sugar because i love to eat sugar
Participant: i wish that i would not procrastinate because i've gotten a lot better about that but i still do and that can be challenging
Participant: um and i wish that i um
Participant: xxx
Participant: i don't know
Participant: uh
Participant: i think i wish that i was in a relationship
Participant: so
Participant: probably those things
Ellie: okay_confirm (okay)
Ellie: feelbadly (tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself)
Participant: mm
Participant: hmm
Participant: so at the last organization i used to work at
Participant: i had a boss and she was
Participant: i don't feel like she was um
Participant: i don't think we were very compatible um and she uh
Participant: used to push my buttons or so i thought
Participant: and so um
Participant: one day she was really upset about something um because a board member had called her up and asked her a question and she didn't have the answer
Participant: um and he was upset about something and
Participant: it was something to do with my department so she called me into her office and let me know how unhappy she was
Participant: um
Participant: but it wasn't i i've been a manager for many years um and i
Participant: have very strong opinions about how you handle
Participant: challenges with people <peo> with staff members
Ellie: yeah2 (yeah)
Participant: and the way that she handled the situation with me was really inappropriate i thought
Participant: um and she clearly was trying to frighten me and make me feel
Participant: um you know incompetent or at least that's the the way that i felt about it
Participant: and um
Participant: i did you know
Participant: i tried to be very calm and
Participant: said that i would take care of it and i did take care of it um but
Participant: uh after that our relationship wasn't really the same and i ended up staying <st> uh leaving there
Participant: to go back to the old organization that i'd worked for not that long afterwards because i just didn't really have a lot of respect for her after she did that to me
Participant: or after we had that interaction so
Ellie: yeah_downer (yeah)
Ellie: isee_downer (i see)
Ellie: advice_back (what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago)
Participant: <laughter>
Participant: so i heard this piece of advice the other day and or uh or this
Participant: thing and that i thought was really profound and i wish that i had
Participant: read it back then
Participant: which is
Participant: um when you think about buying something instead of thinking
Participant: uh oh
Participant: here's this beautiful coat it's a hundred dollars i want it i'm gonna buy it
Participant: it uh don't think of it as costing a hundred dollars think of it as costing ten times that
Participant: because that's effectively what your money could do if you didn't spend it on that coat but instead invested it
Participant: you know
Participant: intelligently um you would have ten times that much money eventually so
Participant: you should really think about it in those terms and um i think i've been much more a consumer than a saver and so i wish that i had uh
Participant: been more aware of that ten or twenty years ago
Ellie: hmmB (hmm)
Ellie: Ellie17Dec2012_08 (what are you most proud of in your life)
Participant: <sigh> probably
Participant: scrubbed_entry
Participant: um they asked me to be his um godparent and his guardian if anything should happen to them
Participant: and that meant a lot to me because it it made me feel like they trusted me and thought that i was a good person the kinda person that could take care of their child should something happen to them
Participant: so
Ellie: okay_confirm (okay)
Ellie: Ellie17Dec2012_10 (tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed)
