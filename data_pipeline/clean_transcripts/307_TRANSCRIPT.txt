Ellie: hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment think of me as a friend i don't judge i can't i'm a computer
Ellie: i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential
Participant: <laughter>
Ellie: where are you from originally
Participant: um moscow
Ellie: really
Ellie: why'd you move to l_a
Participant: um my family moved to the u_s and then i moved down here eventually for college
Ellie: how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a
Participant: uh it took a long time to i've been living here for about a year since i graduated so there's been a lot of ups and downs but finally gotten adjusted to it so it took a while though
Ellie: that's good
Ellie: how do you like your living situation
Participant: it goes off and on i have two roommates and there's always a little bit of drama here and there between
Ellie: [laughter]
Participant: the girls but for the most part after a year and a couple months i think we finally learned how to live together but it was pretty much like a reality t_v show for a while
Ellie: yeah
Ellie: how do you know them
Participant: one's from college and the other one we found on craigslist
Ellie: how close are you to them
Participant: it varies depending on whether or not we're mad at each other so um
Participant: i guess pretty close
Participant: right now we're kinda distant
Ellie: aww
Ellie: tell me more about that
Participant: oh about the distant
Ellie: yes
Participant: okay um well we  haven't seen each other we haven't hung out in like two weeks
Participant: 'cause one of them got into like this car accident and um so she's been distant since then and kinda locks herself up in her room
Ellie: uh oh
Participant: and the other one is always working late so we just our our scheduling has been off and no one's really made an attempt to hang out with anyone so it's kind of
Participant: we're just waiting for someone i guess to make the first move
Ellie: yeah that sucks
Participant: it's okay it'll get better
Ellie: yeah
Ellie: how are you at controlling your temper
Participant: it depends with whom
Participant: i'm
Participant: dealing with i guess i would say with some people i guess with my family not very good my boyfriend it's not very good
Participant: but with other people that i might not know so well then i'm able to control it a little bit more but it'll be more passive aggressive than like full on anger
Ellie: why
Participant: oh 'cause i don't want them to see me as a bitch [laughter]
Ellie: [laughter]
Ellie: that makes sense
Participant: yeah
Ellie: who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life
Participant: uh probably my best friend nicole
Participant: she's probably been we've been best friends for like
Participant: god since high school freshman year of high school is when we first met so long time so yeah
Ellie: wow
Participant: um
Ellie: can you give me an example of that
Participant: of
Participant: of what
Ellie: how do you know them
Participant: uh my friend nicole
Ellie: yeah
Participant: um we met in french class freshman year of high school
Participant: we were in the same class and then we kinda started doing homework together and we had a lot of class the same classes together and so we just kinda started hanging out and then we just became closer and have stayed really close since then
Ellie: nice
Participant: mhm
Ellie: what are some things you like to do for fun
Participant: um
Participant: uh going out with friends going to bars going dancing biking hiking
Participant: staying active um going to the movies going out to eat at restaurants uh photography
Participant: um
Participant: just hanging out with friends i guess
Participant: whatever
Ellie: okay
Ellie: how close are you to your family
Participant: uh
Participant: it varies like i'm really close to them when it comes to things about like school work um
Participant: those kinds of
Participant: things but when it comes to relationships and friendships and more personal personal things
Participant: i don't really discuss that with them
Ellie: mm
Participant: so i guess superficially close
Ellie: okay
Participant: but i rely on them a lot so we're close i guess
Ellie: that's good
Participant: mhm
Ellie: what are some things that make you really mad
Participant: uh that's a good question um i guess it depends who it is again
Participant: i guess people who are inconsiderate unthoughtful flakey ignorant
Participant: and
Participant: uh
Participant: conceited [cons] uh yeah i guess those kinds of people and when people just um
Participant: what makes me mad that's a good question i guess a lot of things make me mad [laughter]
Participant: but it's mostly how people react to um different situations can make me angry i guess
Ellie: yeah
Ellie: when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
Participant: uh yesterday
Participant: and it was my boyfriend and we argued because he's trying to be healthy and workout and save money
Participant: and so and
Participant: so by doing that what he does is he orders pizza in so he's not saving money and he's not being healthy
Participant: and so i got frustrated with him 'cause i'm constantly trying to push him to be healthy and each time he's like i'm gonna do it i'm gonna do it so he's constantly breaking promises that's another thing that makes me angry is people that don't follow through
Ellie: [laughter]
Ellie: yeah
Ellie: do you feel that way often
Participant: about other people or about myself or angry
Ellie: whatever comes to your mind
Participant: xxxx [laughter]
Participant: um
Participant: angry i guess i'll go with that no i don't feel angry often
Ellie: okay
Ellie: what's your dream job
Participant: dang it
Participant: that is a tough one how 'bout just getting paid to be me
Participant: um i don't know that what i'm kind of trying to figure out right now 'cause i quit my full time job 'cause i hated it it was just mostly sitting in an office all day which i thought was extremely boring
Participant: so now i work in a restaurant job and i'm trying to look for a second job to support myself um
Participant: my dream job
Participant: i don't know what it would be but i know it would involve people and i'd love to have some kind of like finished product or some kind of accomplishment towards the end
Participant: i guess it's something that i realized
Participant: i like to see
Participant: the result from all my hard work 'cause i majored in sociology and as much as i loved that major is you realize it's a whole lot of theorizing and arguing but with no real solution so it's just like at the end all you have is just these theoretical elements that you can't really do anything with and nothing to show for your work except for a piece of paper with your essays or notes so
Ellie: mhm
Ellie: yeah
Participant: something to do with people and maybe something artistic i love photography
Participant: i love cooking baking in particularly so i don't know something
Participant: in that
Participant: realm i guess
Ellie: okay
Ellie: do you travel a lot
Participant: i used to travel a lot my family is known for traveling we've gone to
Participant: gosh seven eight different countries i've lived in three or four different countries
Ellie: wow
Participant: i haven't traveled a lot lately just because i have no money and jobs kinda tie you down but i would love to have that
Participant: i guess my dream job would be a photographer that for national geographic that would be awesome
Ellie: yeah
Participant: um or a huge photographer that travels that'd be awesome too but anyways um yeah i do travel a lot
Ellie: what do you enjoy about traveling
Participant: in the new places new faces new experiences i get restless very easily so it's nice to constantly be on the move and
Participant: see different things and see different cultures and types of people and just not get stuck in the same routine i hate the routine and mundaneness of everyday life so it's nice to
Participant: stir things up
Ellie: i see what you mean
Ellie: i'd love to hear about one of your trips
Participant: oh gosh okay um
Participant: i'm trying to think
Participant: one of my trips
Participant: i guess we can talk about i don't know it's funny even though i've been to lots of different countries one of my most memorable memorable trips is
Participant: one of the trips that i took with my family i was a three week roadtrip with my family there's five of us packed in a tiny little station wagon
Ellie: oh my gosh
Participant: i know needless to say it's like when you're that close proximity for three weeks camping you start getting on each others' nerves but it was really fun and like even though i've traveled so many places
Participant: i realized that there's like such a beauty in the american landscape and so we were all around the southwest and the grand canyon to zion to the grand tetons to yellowstone and it was absolutely amazing just seeing all that natural beauty so
Participant: um
Participant: and we saw a grizzly bear black bear lots of bison a wolf and it was really cool those kinds of i don't know natural wonders also really amaze me 'cause those things aren't man made
Participant: and as as pretentious as it sounds after a while europe kinda gets not old but it's like you know you get the same idea like
Participant: white old white men building great buildings and art work and it's beautiful and all but like you just kind of like okay i wanna see something that's natural and beautiful
Participant: or something that's different too
Ellie: yeah
Ellie: i see what you mean
Participant: cool
Ellie: how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep
Participant: um
Participant: pretty easy as long as I
Participant: get well no i always sleep so easy
Ellie: what are you like when you don't sleep well
Participant: oh grumpy and just very lethargic and just low energy don't say much and just kinda off in my own world
Ellie: do you feel that way often
Participant: i not not anymore i usually get enough sleep and i've been working out more so it's kind of
Participant: energizing me so no it's not too bad
Participant: that's good
Ellie: have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately
Participant: uh i guess i've just been more negative but it has to do with like circumstances kind of like uh it's been about five months since i quit my full time job haven't found anything else haven't really found anything else i'm interested in
Participant: so
Participant: it's more of just like ugh what am i doing da da da that kind of thing
Ellie: yeah
Ellie: it can be tough to find a good job these days
Participant: yeah it's it is hard the market and just like i'm very picky 'cause i don't wanna just sittin in a little my own cubicle 'cause i quit my job exactly for that reason so why go back to another job just do the same exact thing that i quit my other job for
Ellie: mhm
Participant: so it's just like i have to make it worthwhile that i quit my last job to get a better job so it's just kinda like i'm stuck in this section of just like living paycheck to paycheck
Participant: barely making it and just waiting for the right opportunity to come across but it's like
Participant: when do i give up and sell my soul and go back to the corporate world of sitting in little cubicles i don't know
Ellie: that sounds really hard
Participant: yeah it is hard but i mean i guess everyone goes through that same situation after college so
Participant: but i guess it's tough 'cause a lot of my friends 'cause i went to a pretty good school and you know i have a friend who's teaching english in afghanistan and i have another one who's met the president you know and one that's doing teach for america another friend who's in harvard uh school for like harvard masters [mass] you know getting her masters so it's kind of like ahh
Participant: all that comparison and then here i am working a little restaurant job so
Ellie: yeah
Ellie: do you feel down
Participant: uh i do sometimes yes but i'm going to hawaii next week so right now i'm fine [laughter]
Ellie: nice
Participant: yes
Participant: but yeah usually it's been kind of like down because
Participant: i'm just trying to find like what
Participant: i'm supposed to like you know what do i want to do next and like money situations which is very stressful especially when you have school loans to pay off insurance rent car loans like it's just groceries like i can't even afford groceries
Participant: so it's just hard to like live this way especially after you've paid so much money for like an amazing college education so it's a little bit frustrating but there's a lot of people in the same situation
Ellie: yeah
Ellie: i'm sorry
Participant: it's all good
Ellie: have you been diagnosed with depression
Participant: uh no i don't think so but i mean
Participant: i think everyone goes through depression here and there so i don't know if you can
Participant: but not like medically diagnose i'm not on meds
Ellie: okay
Ellie: have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d
Participant: nope
Ellie: have you ever served in the military
Participant: nope
Ellie: okay
Ellie: what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago
Participant: oh let's see
Participant: uh to try lots of different things and not be afraid to fail
Participant: 'cause i'm one of those people if i'm not gonna be the best at something then i'm just not gonna try i accept the best or nothing at all go big or go home
Participant: so but i think i would've told my high school self that go and try lots of things even if it means i'm not gonna be the best at it
Participant: so
Participant: ten years ago
Ellie: like what
Participant: well that would've made me like twelve so
Participant: [laughter] um i used to do a lot of things i i used to act
Participant: i think i would've continued doing that i used to write a lot when i was younger i used to write miniature like little stories  short stories for my parents all the time
Participant: and i kind of stopped doing those things 'cause it's like oh i'm not good at it so i'm not gonna do it
Participant: and i think if i just continued doing those things and tried you know different classes
Participant: um i don't know different sports i kinda just stuck with soccer growing up i don't know just
Participant: expand myself more rather than like find something i'm good at and just stay with it but never really try harder
Participant: kinda just like stay i always kinda stayed at one level but once i'm good i just stay for good
Participant: i don't try to go above that
Participant: if that makes any sense
Ellie: yeah
Ellie: yeah
Ellie: what do you do to relax
Participant: uh right now it's super lame but i watch t_v
Participant: [laughter]
Participant: but i used to read a i used to read on my off time or just listen to music or just take a nap
Participant: or bake but now it's just like since i'm on my feet all day and like constantly interacting with people i just kinda wanna unwind by like sitting and lying on the couch and being like i'm done
Participant: so
Ellie: yeah
Ellie: what's one of your most memorable experiences
Participant: [laughter]
Participant: that's a tough question
Participant: um probably the day i got accepted into pomona college
Participant: um
Participant: i was a freshman at wellesley college which is the women's college back east
Participant: and i hated it from like the second from like the first week i just knew that i chose the wrong college and i was like miserable for the entire year
Ellie: aww
Participant: and i only only applied to one school to transfer pomona college like that's out in claremont
Participant: and um
Participant: i didn't think i was gonna get in and i was 'cause it was like a four percent acceptance rate and i was like what are the chances like this is ridiculous i don't think i'm gonna get in
Participant: and i was like you know the thought of going back to wellesley was super depressing
Ellie: mhm
Participant: um
Participant: but then i got an email from one of the admission counselors that i had met when i was visiting pomona and he was like hi tatiana like
Participant: um
Participant: just wanted to see if you had any last minute questions about pomona hope all is well
Participant: and i was like why would he be emailing me the day we find out if we got you know accepted or not
Participant: um unless i got the acceptance and so sure enough a couple hours later i got the email that i was accepted into pomona and i was ecstatic that was like that best day of my life i was so happy
Participant: that's probably one
Ellie: that's great
Participant: yeah
Participant: it was awesome then i took my mom and my little brother out to dinner and i went and bought myself some new dresses went and just like went crazy dyed my hair pierced my nose i was like let's start this whole thing over so [laughter]
Ellie: awesome
Participant: yeah
Ellie: how would your best friend describe you
Participant: bubbly
Participant: fun
Participant: maybe moody you never know what you're gonna get sometimes um
Ellie: [laughter]
Participant: probably
Participant: uh definitely friendly
Participant: um and pretty like a positive person
Participant: um
Participant: but sometimes maybe a little bit
Participant: aggressive but
Participant: for the most part i think positive things i mean she's my best friend so [laughter]
Ellie: okay
Ellie: when was the last time you felt really happy
Participant: huh
Participant: really happy
Participant: oh when i was in mexico
Participant: over winter well
Participant: no i don't know
Participant: my boyfriend took me on a sailing trip down in
Participant: san clemente and that was really fun and we just like went sailing and walked around the missions hung out on the beach that was really fun
Participant: that was a good time
Ellie: that sounds like a great situation
Participant: yeah it was cool
Ellie: okay i think i've asked everything i need to thanks for sharing your thoughts with me
Ellie: goodbye
Participant: [laughter] bye
