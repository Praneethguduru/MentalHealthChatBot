Ellie: how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a

Ellie: are you still working in that
Participant: um no not at the moment

Ellie: what's your dream job
Participant: my dream job oh
Participant: i don't really know i think i just wanna help people however i can and um
Participant: i just like working with people in the realm of psychology so i think i may already have my dream job <laughter>
Ellie: what do you do to relax
Participant: to relax i like to read or watch movies um i like to go to the beach and just watch the sunset or um hang out with friends
Ellie: what are some things that make you really mad
Participant: things that make me really mad um probably injustice towards other people
Participant: um people being mistreated or abused um and people being lied to and deceived including myself i hate being lied to <laughter>
Ellie: what do you do when you're annoyed
Participant: when i'm annoyed uh depends on the situation but
Participant: i try to just
Participant: like count to ten and take a deep breath and and not let my emotions cause me to react in a negative way so i just try and like calm down before i say anything
Ellie: how are you at controlling your temper
Participant: um
Participant: it depends again on the situation and like who i'm angry with um most of the time i'm pretty good at controlling it but sometimes i think like
Participant: like most people i'll lash out at the people that i'm closest to at times and and those moments i'm not that good at controlling it
Ellie: when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
Participant: <sigh> when was the last time i argued with someone
Participant: it was probably with my parents um
Participant: i've been having some some car trouble lately and
Participant: i'm also running low on money so i'm sure i don't even remember exactly but i'm sure we kind of probably fought about the fact that
Participant: i you know need to be more self-sufficient and independent take care of my own <laughter> things like car issues
Ellie: how close are you to your family
Participant: i am very close with my family they're still in oklahoma but i talk to them on the phone all the time
Ellie: who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life
Participant: oh definitely i mean
Participant: my mom i think um she's probably the person that i'm closest to and she just
Participant: she's a great role model she's a wonderful person and she's very hardworking and very unselfish and i just wanna be like her in those ways
Ellie: what's one of your most memorable experiences
Participant: oh
Participant: probably the time i went bungee jumping over the nile river in uganda
Participant: um i still kinda have flashbacks of that moment just freefalling it was like the coolest experience ever and i love doing things that are crazy like that so it was a fun time <laughter>
Ellie: do you travel a lot
Participant: yeah well i have <ha> i have traveled a lot nowadays i don't travel so much anymore but i used to work for a cruise line um norwegian cruise line and so i would go
Participant: travel all the time with them and then i also did an eleven month long trip around the world uh it was a mission trip so i just went and helped out in different third world countries it was really cool
Ellie: what do you enjoy about traveling
Participant: uh i just love going to different places seeing new places and meeting all different types of people um
Participant: because it's easy to just like get so absorbed in your own small bubble that you forget that there's a huge world out there and there's
Participant: all different types of people with all different types of beliefs and it's just really cool to be able to branch out and see and meet those types of people and see just the
Participant: diversity and the terrain of the earth even and the way that the earth looks in different places is cool
Ellie: have you ever served in the military
Participant: no i have not served in the military <laughter>
Ellie: have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d
Participant: nope
Ellie: have you been diagnosed with depression
Participant: no i've never been formally diagnosed although i would say i've probably diagnosed myself with depression um just after having studied it a lot in psychology throughout the years i've
Participant: i'm probably ninety nine percent sure that i've struggled with depression off and on so yeah
Ellie: how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep
Participant: lately it's been pretty easy but throughout the years i've definitely had a lot of issues with insomnia um just like either not being able to fall asleep
Participant: or just like waking up constantly throughout the night and so right now i'm not really experiencing too much of that but in the past it's definitely been an ongoing issue for me
Ellie: what are you like when you don't sleep well
Participant: i'm not a pleasant person when i don't sleep well sleep is extremely like important for me i think maybe more so than a lot of people i i like need good sleep to function
Ellie: how have you been feeling lately
Participant: i've been feeling really good um
Participant: over the past several months i was unemployed um after coming out here and
Participant: that was really really tough um and i just recently got offered my job um just like last week so i definitely think i've been going through
Participant: a lot of crap and just a lot of depression but it's like lifted a lot of it has been lifted off me because i don't have that pressure any longer of like how am i gonna make ends meet this city's really expensive and i don't have a job and
Participant: so i feel i feel much more relieved than i have been feeling which is good <laughter>
Ellie: have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately
Participant: um yeah well i mean just like i said over the past week or so i've become a lot more
Participant: positive i was kind of like feeling a bit like a hermit in a way it's just hard like being in a new city and not really knowing too many people and
Participant: of course like i said not having a job kind of causes you to
Participant: kind of
Participant: just like be in your own shell i guess and that was kinda how it was how it's been for me and um just since i got offered the job i just have so much more
Participant: confidence and like positivity that um things are are starting to work out for me which is good <laughter>
Ellie: when was the last time you felt really happy
Participant: oh it was probably a couple of days ago actually i went um
Participant: i went to explore a part of the south bay area that i hadn't really been to before and
Participant: it was i was just gonna go for a jog along the beach and it was really foggy outside and then the fog started to lift and
Participant: um it was just beautiful and then i i went for a drive up off kind of off this like cliff where there's beautiful scenery that i'd never seen before and i just
Participant: like was overwhelmed with how pretty it was and i was just like oh i can't believe that i get to live here so that was definitely a happy moment for me <laughter>
Ellie: how would your best friend describe you
Participant: my best friend would probably say that i'm very daring and
Participant: bold and fearless um
Participant: that i'm unique
Participant: and artistic
Participant: and i don't i would guess that she'd probably say that i'm a non-conformist i don't really think the way that a lot of people do and i question everything so which can be a good or bad thing but yeah <laughter>
Ellie: what are you most proud of in your life
Participant: um
Participant: probably
Participant: just like
Participant: the fact that i i really try to live my life with like no regrets and just i try to live a very
Participant: exciting life in a way and i think that especially ever since i finished college and have been traveling like i have and
Participant: i've tried moving all different places by myself so i think just the fact that i i'm not really afraid i don't let things hold me back i just if i want something or if i wanna do something i can just do it and
Participant: i guess in a way like i like that about myself and the fact that i'm really independent and can just go and do whatever i feel like doing even if it's hard i still i'm proud that i've overcome a lot of those struggles
Ellie: is there anything you regret
Participant: oh there's like minor things that i regret throughout my life but there's not anything really major 'cause i think pretty much everything that i've done i've learned from whether it's good or bad so
Participant: i wouldn't really change anything
Ellie: what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago
Participant: oh <sigh>
Participant: i would say i would tell myself when i was a kid that i
Participant: should just keep dreaming big and don't let anything that anyone says like stop me from believing that anything's possible because
Participant: um
Participant: i guess as i've grown into an adult i've really seen and started to really believe that truly anything is possible and if you really want something you can go after it and you can get it so i would just
Participant: tell myself to never give up and just always believe that you can do what you wanna do
Ellie: tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed
Participant: oh
Participant: let's see that's kind of hard <laughter>
Participant: um oh i guess
Participant: i went home recently for christmas back to oklahoma and um i got to see some of my friends from college that i hadn't seen in some of 'em i hadn't seen in like since
Participant: i graduated so um which has been like four years ago so
Participant: um it was really awesome just to go out with them and we went to dinner and we went out afterwards and just had a good night and it was really really fun
Ellie: okay i think i've asked everything i need to
Participant: cool
Ellie: thanks for sharing your thoughts with me
Participant: you're welcome
Ellie: goodbye
Participant: bye
