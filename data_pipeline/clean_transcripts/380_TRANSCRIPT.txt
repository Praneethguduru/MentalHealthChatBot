Participant: that's what i just said
Ellie: study (what did you study at school)
Participant: film
Ellie: hard_decision (how did you decide to do that)
Participant: you know that's actually a question i've been asking myself i knew <kne> i know
Participant: i my entire life i've had like phases of interest so when i was like very very very young i was really into like the first phase that i remember was keys and then tools like i would go around collecting keys
Participant: and then i'd go around collecting tool like just every sort of tool i had a toolbox my parents have told me that i had a phase before that with which was balls like various balls
Participant: um
Participant: and then i was really into like insects collecting insects and reptiles and and stuff <stu> and like animals and then it was a dinosaur phase and
Participant: at a certain <cert> and eh at a certain point i got really into um
Participant: like rap <ra> like music like first <fi> at first rap and then uh guitar and then acting and then at some point in there i i had told <to> i rememeber telling someone that right now i'm interested in
Participant: playwriting and and poetry but eventually i was going to be interested in in uh film
Participant: like i i could kinda see the trajectory coming but i don't remember what led me to that conclusion i think i just always
Participant: i was <wa> led a sheltered life uh as far as movies are concerned i didn't my parents didn't let me see an r-rated movie until i was like in high school almost like
Ellie: hmm1 (hmm)
Participant: um
Participant: and uh and i never
Participant: uh so i never saw an r-rated movie i was also very squeamish like i remember when i was
Participant: fairly young maybe like six i saw star wars
Participant: the first scene in darth <dar> star wars darth vader crack like breaks a guy's neck
Ellie: uh_huh (uh huh)
Participant: and so just a little scene very at the very very beginning and that like freaked me out and i had to leave the room so
Ellie: wild_laughter5 ((laughter))
Participant: i'm not really sure uh
Participant: yeah it's it's it's
Participant: um i don't i'm not exactly sure how i got into film
Participant: but
Participant: uh i've always been fascinated by like
Participant: how people interact and what like you know acting and stuff so and movies in general
Ellie: still_working_on_X (are you still working in that)
Participant: i am yes
Ellie: job_virtually (i love my job you could almost say it's virtually made for me what's your dream job)
Participant: um to be a filmmaker to be able to direct
Participant: and uh put <pu> put together
Participant: and make <ma> like i guess direct i don't mm use that word so much 'cause it i think i think of it more as like i i want the opportunity to put together and make
Participant: movies
Participant: uh or to make movies is probably the best way to do it uh to say it 'cause i want you know i want involvement in all the
Participant: all the processes but
Ellie: mm (mm)
Participant: i guess the best parabole for that would be a director
Participant: directing
Ellie: okay_confirm (okay)
Ellie: family_relationship (tell me about your relationship with your family)
Participant: well it's a lot better when i'm not living with them
Participant: um
Participant: my
Participant: i guess um
Participant: it's funny you should ask ellie um
Participant: i've been thinking about it a lot lately i i think i'm close in my entire family i'm closest with my dad um i get along with my brother and sister you know like but i don't
Participant: when away
Participant: like my brother's in a foreign country right now so i don't have the opportunity to talk with him but like
Participant: i spend more time talking to my dad than anyone else 'cause i feel like he's the most like
Participant: of all my family he's the one who most accepts me and like
Participant: um thinks positively about me
Participant: um so it's i have like a
Participant: a complicated relationship with my parents
Participant: i mean <mea> and my family in general
Ellie: mhm (mhm)
Ellie: shyoutgoing (do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing)
Participant: well on the myers uh briggs personality test i'm uh i'm an extrovert but lately <late> like since moving but i'm not like
Participant: um
Participant: i'm not i probably would consider myself on the scheme of extroversion uh or on the scale of extroversion sorry um i would consider myself extremely introverted um
Ellie: why2 (why)
Participant: i just i see other extroverts and just no matter who they're around they're able to like strike up conversations and i'm i'm a fairly shy person i'm sort of like
Participant: uh
Participant: or inhibited person maybe um
Participant: so i like to like
Participant: until
Participant: yeah i'm but i'm working on it i'm working on it
Ellie: okay_confirm (okay)
Ellie: relax_fishtank (sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax)
Participant: um well in the past i would smoke weed but i've quit smoking weed
Participant: so now i you know i have a glass of wine and
Participant: maybe watch a movie
Participant: um
Participant: i don't have or maybe go like depending if it's like an xxx if it's um
Participant: if it's a worn out sort of stress like i'm just like
Participant: then i that's what i do but if it's a more like anxious type stress i might
Participant: go on a uh an intense walk don't really exercise that much but i like
Participant: you know competitive sports and hiking
Ellie: yeah3 (yeah)
Ellie: control_temper (how are you at controlling your temper)
Participant: pretty good
Ellie: last_argument (when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about)
Participant: well i always like arguing um
Participant: i wouldn't call arguing necessarily losing my temper
Participant: um
Participant: i i enjoy uh a vicious debate um
Participant: but i don't
Participant: as long as my like
Participant: 'cause i won't like revert to personal you know attacks
Participant: uh in my in my arguments i try to keep it on subject
Ellie: uh_huh (uh huh)
Participant: um
Participant: and try to explain myself as best i can which can get frustrating 'cause i'm not like the best articulator of what i think
Participant: um
Participant: one of my weaker points i would say
Participant: but um but the last time i had a a heated debate i think that was was that the question
Ellie: yes (yes)
Participant: um
Ellie: bouts_symptoms (when was the last time that happened)
Participant: what happened i forget i forget the question that that i had a heated debate
Ellie: uh_huh (uh huh)
Participant: hmm
Participant: the last time i had a heated debate
Participant: was um i had a heated debate about
Participant: uh the movie boogie nights
Participant: um
Participant: i was <wa> i i didn't lose my temper exactly but i get like very extremely passionate about about
Participant: 'cause i i don't think it's like that good of a movie but the two people who i was i was arguing with were saying that it was like one of the
Participant: like best um best movies <laughter> why did they think it was the best movie
Ellie: why2 (why)
Ellie: yes (yes)
Participant: um
Participant: they think that like there's some there's some sort of they'll as i understand it they have um
Participant: they have a certain uh they think that the
Participant: like all of the stories within boogie nights they have their own um like each of them could be their own separate stories they just think that there's a whole like
Participant: complexity of character within the movie
Participant: and um
Participant: that somehow like
Participant: <sigh> um
Participant: what what were they saying they were saying like the movie
Participant: it like xxx it's like the end of an era
Participant: which makes it like kinda like casino and there's this attention to detail of of of the in the different character like how they
Participant: how they interact in the plot
Participant: um
Participant: kind of like
Participant: uh
Participant: yeah i guess
Participant: i think the heated debate became about like then so from there and uh like personally i it's not like a bad movie or anything but it's
Participant: the um
Participant: i just don't think dirk diggler is like that like meaningful <mean> meaningful of a character like i
Participant: i guess the way i come out i came out of the movie 'cause i had seen it before many years ago and eh i my opinion of it is basically the same even though like i remember like
Ellie: mm (mm)
Participant: in watching it again i was able to reevaluate it
Participant: um there's nothing bad about the movie there's nothing articulable <art> like articulable about that's it's like solid <so> good solid acting you know the directing is good the camera moves are cool
Participant: um
Participant: the eh it really <rea> you know it's cool it's but
Participant: but it's meaningless <mea> for me it was like meaningless and then to and then there were that led us to discuss 'cause a movie that i saw recently that i really did like was django unchained
Ellie: yeah2 (yeah)
Participant: and they both saw that movie and they hated that movie
Participant: and then there was this extreme i guess the heated part of the conversation came about like
Participant: so in the movie django unchained
Participant: um you have django and django is like a kinda he's a two dimensional character but i don't think that that necessarily takes away from what the the big
Participant: the
Participant: big purpose of the movie is
Ellie: right2 (right)
Participant: and um
Participant: and you have doctor king schultz who's this uh
Participant: who's this like his mentor character and the person i was arguing with was saying that he
Participant: was intelligent and uh so and because he was intelligent there's no way he would've risked his life to save django
Participant: or like would've gone into this like second act where they go and they go to this uh uh plantation to to save django's wife etcetera
Participant: and um
Participant: and the reason <rea> the the reason for her giving that argument which like either you buy that he would do that or he wouldn't but the reason for her argument is that an intelligent person would not
Participant: sacrifice themself for someone else
Ellie: hmmB (hmm)
Participant: um which strikes <stri> which strikes me as so like
Participant: um
Participant: like who
Participant: uh like
Participant: she she her basic <ba> her basic argument was that
Participant: altruism <al> like altruism doesn't exist <exi> it was a very ayn rand type argument altruism doesn't exist
Participant: um the only the only thing you can do is serve <ser> like the only thing people do is serve themself
Participant: um so it's not quite ayn rand but it's like the only people <peo> thing that people <peo> like all people are out to serve themself which i'm not arguing that like
Participant: every decision has like a mix of altruism and and so like even the most altruistic type decision there's maybe like kernels of self self-interest in there but she made it sound like self-interest was the only motivating factor
Ellie: yeah3 (yeah)
Participant: in and and like what but what how how horrible is your life if that's like what your ultimate um
Participant: purpose <pur> like if you if you can't like love and sacrifice for other people so it led into an extremely uh passionate debate
Participant: um
Participant: and uh
Participant: somewhat like yeah and it's it uh
Participant: so um so yeah that that i guess that's the the i don't think i necessarily like lost my temper um
Participant: i think of losing my temper as being more
Participant: um
Participant: like i just
Participant: so <s> i i would so <s>
Participant: revert to um ad hominem like attacks
Participant: uh but i i didn't like that's not um
Participant: maybe i was like maybe i was criticizing <crit> like criticizing her world view but it i wasn't like
Participant: well you're an idiot
Participant: you know like it wasn't it didn't it didn't turn into abuse of any sort
Ellie: understand (i understand)
Participant: yeah i'm glad you understand
Participant: <deep breath>
Ellie: memory_erase (tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory)
Participant: an event or a i don't know if i necessarily would want to erase anything from my memory i would say an issue that i have is not being able to remember in as much detail as i would like i remember feelings and moments
Participant: not
Participant: stories um
Participant: like my life doesn't sync <s> always sync together into like a coherent story it's like this moment and that moment and this moment and that moment so
Ellie: hmmB (hmm)
Participant: yeah
Ellie: hard_decisionB (tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make)
Participant: the hardest decision i've ever had to make
Participant: oh geez
Participant: could it just be one of the hardest decisions
Ellie: yeah3 (yeah)
Participant: hmm
Participant: um
Participant: like choosing between two things that it's like
Participant: i guess i i'm having a hard time recalling a moment where i like had to choose between
Participant: two options like no there's no like sophie's choice type moment in my life
Participant: but i but i do think that the decision 'cause i lived in new york for a while i went to school in new york and uh the decision to leave new york after having lived there for five years was a was very very difficult um
Ellie: mhm (mhm)
Participant: and uh but i had to do it
Participant: for money reasons and because all of my all of my core group of friends
Participant: were either like leaving <lea> were most of them were leaving and going other places in the world
Participant: and then uh the one other person who i was close to was living with someone who i did not get along with at all so it was like this situation where i didn't
Participant: i was either gonna live with people who i wasn't as close with or craigslist or or move home and i i think
Participant: it was a tough decision to to leave i i had <ha> in fact it was so tough that the only way i could do it i had to justify it by saying that i would be moving back
Participant: to new york within like a month or two
Participant: uh which wasn't which didn't end up happening but that was the only way that i could
Participant: leave new york
Ellie: isee_downer (i see)
Ellie: difficult (how hard is that)
Participant: it was how hard was that
Participant: or how hard is
Ellie: yes (yes)
Participant: how hard was that
Participant: um
Participant: it was hard
Participant: <laughter> um
Participant: it was it was yeah it was it was just a very like
Participant: isolating isolating <is>
Participant: 'cause also like i'd fallen <fa> like previously to that time i had fallen in love with one of my like closest another one of my close very close friends
Participant: and uh
Participant: that had kind of gone extremely
Participant: badly
Participant: and so i wasn't on speaking terms with her and i couldn't like that whole
Participant: everyone on my list of friends who was like more <mo> closer to xxx her it was wasn't quite like her or me type thing but that that was the way that i kind of
Participant: saw it at the time so i didn't like
Participant: you know just being socially isolated etcetera
Ellie: yeah_downer (yeah)
Ellie: that_sucks (that sucks)
Participant: yeah
Ellie: easy_sleep (how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep)
Participant: well recently it's been awful

Participant: but previous to that night
Participant: so last not last night but the night before last and the night before that i got four hours and two hours of sleep
Participant: um because i was working on set and i would get back

Participant: eh at the beginning where the
Participant: the sheer difficulty of finding a job and finding people to xxx 'cause i moved here 'cause i have a group of friends here or couple of friends but i don't have like a a large number of friends
Participant: and the the push to
Participant: to get out there and meet people and find a job and that sort of pressure was pretty um
Participant: overwhelming at first and i think that i'm slowly like
Participant: coming to terms with that um
Participant: and moving you know moving past it i i but not necessarily <nece> you know like it's still it's still there the pressure's there but i'm just

Participant: full <fu> energy um between <betw> between me and the person writing it and

Participant: just like
Participant: i felt like it yeah i guess that was the
Participant: the last time that was that was like
Participant: eh more than a year ago though but i guess it's hard to hard to think that i haven't been really truly happy since then but when you're making a movie like
