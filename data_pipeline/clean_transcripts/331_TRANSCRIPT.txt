Participant: uh about four years ago
Ellie: what got you to seek help
Participant: um i well i had <ha> i was beaten up and i had uh identity theft
Participant: and uh you know i was just afraid to go out so i needed to get over that so after spending one year in in my home without leaving
Participant: um and just depressed all the time i i said i have to get out and start talking to people and so i did
Ellie: yeah i'm sorry to hear that
Participant: thank you
Ellie: how have you been feeling lately
Participant: um okay i'm panicky about the job situation
Participant: um you know 'cause my bills are pretty high and i don't really have a steady income right now
Ellie: uh huh
Participant: so uh that's what's worrying me the most is my uh financial situation
Ellie: that sounds really hard
Participant: yeah
Ellie: have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately
Participant: um
Participant: yeah i mean
Participant: well basically it's like um i just recently quit drinking all together so i don't drink anymore so i'm noticing
Ellie: that's great
Participant: yeah i mean it's good 'cause of number one i don't have the money and number two i don't like the way i act when i drink
Ellie: mhm
Participant: um so so that's a positive thing but well the when i was drinking it helped me just forget and numb myself
Participant: now i have to feel through the feelings which is pretty good 'cause i can talk my way through them so i guess i'm evolving
Ellie: that's good
Ellie: have you been diagnosed with depression
Participant: uh yeah a long time ago um you know i've taken many medications here and there and um
Participant: they really some of 'em would numb me some of them would
Participant: make me feel hyper so i've recently decided to <t> in the last six months three to six months just to not take anything so i don't take anything i barely even take an aspirin
Participant: just to get my body to a to get my body to a normal state
Ellie: how hard is that
Ellie: yeah
Ellie: did you think you had a problem before you found out
Participant: um not really
Ellie: what were your symptoms
Participant: always worrying just a lot of worrying always worrying worrying worrying about everything oh what happens if i get in car accident what happens if i can't pay my mortgage what happens if i
Participant: eh eh just so many things i worry about and that's what was making me depressed
Ellie: yeah
Ellie: do you feel like therapy's useful
Participant: i do
Participant: at some point i've had
Participant: some good therapists and i've had some bad therapists
Participant: um i tend to like the ones that talk back to me
Participant: and kinda give me some guidance as opposed to the ones that just listen
Ellie: mhm
Participant: and then they just say okay your time's up so and just prescribe me medication so i think i'd be better with a psychiatrist <psychia> psychologist as opposed to a psychiatrist
Ellie: yeah i see what you mean
Ellie: what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy
Participant: um
Participant: well i'm not going to therapy now but
Participant: the therapy that i had before um
Participant: was more like people trying to uh just come in and check in and give me medication
Participant: um i have had other therapy where i was back and forth like okay well this is what i think about this and you think about this and that kind of therapy is better
Ellie: mm
Ellie: why did you stop
Participant: um i just
Participant: i wasn't getting the right therapists recently
Participant: so um and i knew the the root of my problem was the drinking 'cause it's a depressant so
Ellie: mhm
Participant: mm you know stopping the drinking is definitely made me have a much clearer mind and just to work through things myself you know
Ellie: yeah
Ellie: okay
Ellie: tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed
Participant: um
Participant: i can't really think of anything right now
Ellie: okay
Ellie: when was the last time you felt really happy
Participant: um
Participant: it's been a long time i can't really think about a time when i felt really happy
Ellie: i'm sorry to hear that
Participant: thank you <sniffle>
Ellie: what's one of your most memorable experiences
Participant: um
Participant: okay when i was a kid
Participant: um
Participant: i had a a little dog and this big dog came and and attacked it and killed it
Participant: so then a little while later my father
Participant: came and he says to my brother and me we were kids go to the car there's two packages in the car so go get them
Participant: so i was like yeah yeah yeah yeah 'cause i never listened to my parents so i was just like a spoiled brat but finally he said go to the car what's that
Ellie: <laughter>
Ellie: <laughter>
Participant: oh okay he said go to the car and get this out of the car so i finally went and when i opened the door there was a new dog and a bag of dog food so that's one of my memorable esperiences
Ellie: wow
Ellie: that's great
Participant: yeah 'cause i'm an animal lover so
Ellie: yeah
Ellie: is there anything you regret
Participant: um
Participant: just the way that i've treated people before when
Participant: i was hurting i was really mean or rude to people
Participant: when i felt like you know i was hurting i had to hurt everybody around me so um but when <wh> ever since i stopped the drinking i don't do that anymore so
Ellie: mhm
Participant: so i think the problem is is the drinking and so now that i've let that go uh 'cause i was doing it for the wrong reasons you know i was doing it to not not feel i wasn't doing it to be sociable
Ellie: that's good
Ellie: yeah
Ellie: what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago
Participant: get in a career that is really stable
Participant: like uh eh you know like a a doctor or a nurse or an attorney
Participant: something that you know or in advertising i should've gone into that a sales position is it could be very well and very good or very bad so
Participant: you always have to be on it in sales you can make a ton of money in sales but when you make your money save your money don't go spend it on extravagant things
Ellie: yeah
Ellie: that makes sense
Ellie: what are some things that usually put you in a good mood
Participant: um when i have a job when i when i'm able to work
Participant: uh when i'm helping other people
Participant: uh when other people around me are happy and laughing when i can make people laugh that that puts me in a good mood
Ellie: that's great
Ellie: okay i think i've asked everything i need to
Participant: okay thank you
Ellie: thanks for sharing your thoughts with me
Participant: you're welcome thank you
Ellie: goodbye
Participant: bye
