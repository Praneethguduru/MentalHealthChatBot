Participant: diagnosed with uh paranoid schizophrenia so that was really tough
Participant: and it's hard for me to talk to him because you know he's he's not really all there anymore like he used to be
Participant: so it's one of those things where i feel like i'm kind of ignoring him and i don't wanna do that but at the same time i don't know his tendencies
Participant: he could be a little you know
Participant: crazy

Participant: you have to accept you know the actions you know circumstances
Participant: that took place
Participant: so you know i manned up and you know i guess i think i'm better off for it
