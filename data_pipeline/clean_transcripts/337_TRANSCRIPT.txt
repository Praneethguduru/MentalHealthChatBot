Ellie: hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today

Ellie: i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started
Ellie: and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential
Ellie: are you okay with this
Participant: yeah
Ellie: okay
Ellie: so how are you doing today
Participant: i'm doing okay
Participant: how are you doing
Ellie: that's good
Ellie: i'm great thanks
Ellie: where are you from originally
Participant: i'm originally from like a suburb <su> a suburb of l_a from the san gabriel valley
Ellie: really
Ellie: what are some things you really like about l_a
Participant: i like the diversity i like the vibe of the city i've lived other places and it's just
Participant: not
Participant: as happy here i feel like i can really thrive here so i just like l_a
Ellie: mhm
Participant: like all the things that are so close together then there's a lot of interesting things that totally different parts of the city just miles away from each other
Ellie: yeah
Ellie: i see what you mean
Ellie: what are some things you don't really like about l_a
Participant: uh
Participant: don't like the traffic don't like all the cars but i can live with it i mean
Participant: there's not that much i don't like
Ellie: okay
Ellie: what'd you study at school
Participant: i studied music um vocal performance i studied music technology things like that
Ellie: awesome
Ellie: are you still working in that
Participant: yes
Ellie: what do you do now
Participant: right now um i sing in an opera company but my i do have a day job because it doesn't pay that much unless you're actually working for the l_a opera
Participant: so i do have a day job i work at a call center that caters mostly to
Participant: performers and actors and things like that and it's really good because if i get a call i can call in and change my shift very easily
Participant: so it's actually a pretty good gig
Ellie: okay
Participant: and i do some uh technology gigs sometimes you know it's do some recording some live sound stuff but i'm kinda wanna get away from that
Participant: do some video work sometimes but again i wanna get away from that i wanna go back to the
Ellie: why
Participant: because i find that performing more is more interesting i like being talent more than i like being crew <laughter>
Participant: so i kinda wanna get away from that side and start working more toward actually doing what i wanna do with my life
Ellie: okay
Ellie: do you consider yourself an introvert
Participant: sometimes i mean per my personal life yeah so i do have a shell that i put out there to deal with people
Participant: but if i'm at home you know i'd kinda rather just keep to myself or my husband or my cats or whatever talk to family
Participant: don't really have too many close friends <clears throat> but yeah you know
Participant: i'd rather keep to myself
Ellie: uh huh
Ellie: how close are you to your family
Participant: uh moderately close to the family that i have left i've actually lost a lot of family in the last ten years or so
Ellie: i'm sorry to hear that
Participant: but like
Participant: thank you <laughter> but like uh my i'm close to my husband and
Participant: you know i've got couple of cousins i talk to and my aunt that i have an aunt that i talk to a bit but it's not like we're interacting every day close together
Ellie: right
Participant: but it's
Participant: somewhat close
Ellie: okay
Ellie: what do you do to relax
Participant: mostly i sing or i read or i write or
Participant: just
Participant: hang out and try to
Participant: clear my mind of all thoughts sometimes it doesn't work but i try to do that and try to just
Participant: clear everything and see what starts coming back in
Participant: and
Participant: sometimes <ss> sometimes that works sometimes it doesn't but mostly creating things
Participant: um contacting my family some <so> you know through facebook or whatever
Ellie: uh huh
Participant: works but
Participant: mostly in my free time i create things
Ellie: okay
Ellie: do you travel a lot
Participant: i'd like to travel more i like to travel by car a lot um
Participant: i mean my idea of
Participant: like having a birthday celebration would be to go on a road trip
Participant: and i like to travel more um
Participant: i would love to travel for work things or whatever but i don't get as much of an opportunity as i would like to to travel
Ellie: what do you enjoy about traveling
Participant: seeing <see> uh particularly traveling by car seeing like the landscape change seeing people change seeing you know feeling the vibrations of the area change
Participant: i like just seeing what's out there seeing and i know that there's a bigger world outside of
Participant: where i am and where i live and my world and i like to see that
Ellie: uh huh
Participant: but i like to leave that too and go back to my own world <laughter>
Ellie: <laughter>
Participant: <laughter> <clears throat>
Ellie: i'd love to hear about one of your trips
Participant: um
Participant: let's see
Participant: xxx a trip that i like to take is to make the drive from here to nevada whether i go all the way to vegas or just go to state line
Participant: um my cousin and i would take what we call
Participant: exit one trips because once you get to the first exit of a highway you're either in another state or you're at the end of the highway so we'd take those we'd just
Participant: sort of impromptu with like <li> a day or two notice just move things around just take off
Participant: so those are actually trips that i i like making <mak> 'cause i take off and then just come back sometimes the same day sometimes overnight
Participant: just small short trips that
Participant: aren't very involved but you just get to go and you see things and see how
Participant: um you know the desert landscape looks in different seasons how people react in different times of the year in different areas
Ellie: uh huh
Participant: so close to home but not
Participant: but not close to home close to home but uh still a world away so that 'cause i don't really have time to take like a two week vacation or whatever but that's just little things that
Participant: kinda put things back in perspective and and clear my head and things like that i mean 'cause there's sort of a sense of meditation and zen that you get on a highway that you don't get driving a freeway
Ellie: yeah
Participant: so i i like i like doing that
Ellie: i see what you mean
Ellie: cool
Ellie: when was the last time that happened
Participant: the last time that happened was may of last year that's the last time i was able to do that
Participant: we actually my aunt came over with my cousin who's ten years younger than i am
Participant: and we kinda grew up like sisters and i was about to move away from the inland empire which is where they live
Participant: so they kinda took me on a last hurrah and we drove up to vegas
Participant: and looked around and came back 'cause i actually lived in vegas for awhile but i didn't like it so they kinda
Participant: i showed <show> showed them some of the locals sites around there
Participant: and we came back and was
Participant: you know
Participant: an overnight trip but we were driving the entire time <laughter> so
Ellie: wow
Participant: it was kind of an interesting
Ellie: what are some things that make you really mad
Participant: uh things that are just inherently unfair when people are mean to the elderly or to children or to animals people who can't fight back and they're mean to them just because they can't fight back
Participant: and
Participant: i actually
Participant: like to see people who are
Participant: strong <st> as strong as the people who are being mean standing up and being an advocate
Ellie: yeah
Participant: or what have you
Participant: so i think that's one thing that's makes me really mad just being cruel or mean for no reason
Participant: you know not people <pe> for people who can't fight back or for people who've done nothing to deserve it
Participant: just that kinda really just makes me mad
Ellie: uh huh
Ellie: okay
Ellie: what do you do when you're annoyed
Participant: when i'm annoyed i'll try to just walk away from the situation and if the situation insists on following me then i'll wind up lashing out somehow either
Participant: you know verbally just
Participant: cutting 'em with a quip or
Participant: you know
Participant: i mean i i rarely just i rarely will yell at somebody
Participant: but i'll try to you know
Participant: if i'll try to walk away and defuse it if that doesn't work then i'll let them know that they're annoying me and get away from me <laughter> that usually works
Ellie: has that gotten you in trouble
Participant: not in like legal trouble or anything because usually i'll find a way to
Participant: get them to leave me alone
Participant: um
Participant: so there's not really like big trouble but 'cause i think 'cause it's it it is off-putting and it's not expected <exp> the expected reaction
Participant: and that's actually kind of cultivated in me that it's not the expected reaction 'cause i know that will work and get people away from me so it's not really in trouble and if
Ellie: uh huh
Participant: it's is trouble it's usually trouble that
Participant: it's from their the other person's perspective and it doesn't affect me at all because it's usually a situation i can get out of
Participant: so as long as they leave me alone you know i don't i i'll walk away from it
Ellie: okay
Ellie: when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
Participant: uh the last time i argued with somebody
Participant: like
Participant: person <per> like a person <per> like a family member or an outsider or somebody not in my
Ellie: whatever comes to your mind
Participant: uh the last thing i can think of was
Participant: i
Participant: argued with my husband about the care of my mother-in-law 'cause she's got dementia
Participant: and so we one of the reasons we came out here from the inland empire was to take care of her 'cause she won't go anywhere but l_a
Participant: i mean she is like hardcore angelino like you know we we know we are the we're that in our nature
Participant: but we also know it's cheaper to live elsewhere <laughter> but um so we came out here to take care of her
Ellie: yeah
Participant: and he wants her to be able to stay in her in her apartment and i want her to move in with us
Participant: because it would be cheaper and faster and easier and safer for her if she lived with us but she wants to stay where she is 'cause she can't see that there's inherent danger now because of the disease process
Ellie: yeah
Participant: but he wants her to stay where she he wants her to be able to have what she wants 'cause he's a mama's boy like
Participant: i am i'm a mama's girl even though i've lost my mom like four years ago i'm still a mama's girl and i'll still <st> and i still and i know that
Participant: it
Participant: brings you
Participant: a sense of satisfaction to to carry out their wishes because you care about them so much and that's what they want so you wanna get it for 'em and because you know they you know that happened
Participant: when you were growing up when they tried to give you what you want because you wanted it
Participant: and you wanna do that for them now like sort of giving back to them somebody that you care about somebody you feel deserves it
Participant: but it's kinda dangerous for her you know and i don't want things <thi> something to happen to her
Participant: yet i want her to remain who she is for as long as she can 'cause i know it the disease that she has is gonna erase who she is eventually
Ellie: yeah
Participant: and eventually she will have to be put in a place where they can give her twenty four hour medically trained care
Participant: but until then we can we can handle it you know amongst ourselves 'cause it's not that bad
Participant: but it's getting where she really shouldn't <shou> has no business living by herself anymore
Participant: so the solution right now is he stays there most the time with her and i go back to our house and i it gets stressful and it gets annoying because i do
Participant: i handle the outside things i run the errands i take her to the store things like that he does the day to day things makes sure she has <ha> she eats makes sure she you know has clean clothes things like that
Ellie: uh huh
Participant: so i mean it's a partnership it's a it's
Participant: a dual effort it's very much a dual effort
Participant: but i would like her to move in with us so that was that's like
Participant: a source of it's not really like yelling screaming argument but
Participant: lively discussion <laughter>
Participant: you know than debate
Ellie: i see
Ellie: that sounds really hard
Participant: meh
Participant: it's not insurmountable i mean life's not gonna be easy ever
Participant: and if it is that's when you should worry because that's when somebody can pull the rug out from under you
Participant: so as long as you're on top of things and you're present in your life it's not gonna be easy
Participant: but you deal with it and you you move on
Ellie: yeah
Ellie: who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life
Participant: uh the most positive influence i think have been probably my mother and my grandmother
Participant: 'cause my mom was pretty much a single mom and my grandmother helped raise me and they actually
Participant: gave me a lot of confidence
Participant: and but were realistic about it
Participant: so i mean i think i have sort of a
Participant: realistic sort of a downer temperment <laughter> to myself but they but they helped me see that it's just in me and it's not something i can't get over
Ellie: uh huh
Participant: and that you know life's gonna go on you know my mom would say to me when you're forty you're forty whether you're working at mcdonald's or doing what you want with your life
Participant: and i think that was a big influence on how i lived have how i've lived my life since she's passed
Ellie: that's great
Ellie: is there anything you regret
Participant: i regret not taking care of myself in the last year of my mother's life because i think it may have clouded some of my decisions
Participant: now i do have underlying conditions and everybody in my family is diabetic and i didn't take care of that when she was the last year of her life 'cause i was too busy wanting to get her home
Participant: my focus was to get her home
Ellie: yeah
Participant: so i didn't eat right i didn't take my insulin right um i wound up making myself insulin resistant that that year just 'cause my blood sugar was so high for eh like a year
Participant: eating just horrible foods when i did eat
Participant: so it really took a toll and i really actually made myself very sick
Participant: and i'm wondering well if i didn't
Participant: if i would've taken care of myself and i had my head on completely straight and my my vision <vi> my vision and my thoughts weren't completely <complete> weren't clouded
Participant: would i have made some better decisions on her behalf especially when she needed 'em
Participant: and when she needed me to be to step in and make the decisions for her because she
Participant: uh wound up having a health catastrophe 'cause she had kidney well she had kidney damage that wound up being kidney failure and
Participant: her health insurance provider missed that
Participant: so she wound up having
Ellie: wow
Participant: sort of this whole
Participant: catastrophe where everything at once just started breaking down
Participant: she wound up having a stroke at like fifty one she had had a small stroke
Participant: and it just kinda went down from there so i'm thinking well if i didn't if i had taken care of better care of myself would i have been able to take better care of her
Participant: and i know
Participant: there wasn't anything i would've been able to do to prevent her death but what if i if i would i have been be able to make it easier on her
Participant: if i would have taken care of myself and that's like one huge regret that i have
Ellie: yeah
Ellie: do you think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself
Participant: oh i know i am <laughter> but xxx it's
Participant: my desire to take responsibility
Participant: for everyone and everything that i care about taking responsibility for my own life and me and mine and i know other people i can't really
Participant: direct them into my own vision because they're their own
Participant: individual beings
Participant: and they can't you know
Participant: be what i want them to be and i know they're not going to be
Participant: but i still have you know my ideals
Participant: and i want the way i want everything to go and i want everybody that i care about to be happy and to be able too
Participant: fit into my life
Participant: in a way in the best way possible but i know 'cause they're other beings
Participant: and i know i'm not gonna be able to do that for them and they're not gonna be able to do that for me but it's still my ideals <laughter> so i have to sometimes have to look at it and go well
Ellie: mhm
Participant: is this what i want because i want it or what is what they want and what's their <thei> is it their decision or mine and it's usually it's theirs
Participant: and i know it's theirs so i so if you really care about somebody you're just gonna support them and go with them but
Ellie: yeah
Participant: it's still
Participant: kinda hard <laughter> for for me and know i gotta get over it
Ellie: yeah
Ellie: what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago
Participant: um
Participant: ten or twenty years ago
Participant: probably to have been more assertive in starting my own life because i wound taking care of my mother i mean she
Participant: got sick literally the weekend i graduated from college <laughter> and i had a job lined up and i had to pull out of that because she needed me to take care of her
Participant: and i think i would've been more aggressive about starting my own life getting a job outside
Participant: the house in addition to caring for her getting uh my own job history my own credit history thing like things like that built up instead of becoming just totally her daughter for about ten years
Ellie: uh huh
Participant: so
Participant: i think i i probably would've done that
Participant: um but i tell myself just do that you keep who you are and learn to separate
Participant: your you who you are and what you feel you need to be doing for your family
Participant: to keep a sense of of yourself that's probably what i would've and do things for yourself to keep that sense of yourself that's probably the advance advice of what i would give myself
Ellie: mhm
Participant: ten years ago <laughter>
Ellie: okay
Ellie: have you ever served in the military
Participant: no
Ellie: have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d
Participant: no
Ellie: have you been diagnosed with depression
Participant: no but probably 'cause i haven't gone to a doctor about it <laughter> 'cause i don't wanna know
Participant: and i mean it's not
Participant: i know there've been times in my life where i've been severely depressed and it's usually circumstances
Participant: and had to pull myself out of it but i'd rather pull myself out of it before resorting to treatment
Participant: and of it gets <ge>
Ellie: can you give me an example of that
Participant: um
Participant: after my mother had died i mean it'd been this long battle for a year that we lost and i didn't know
Participant: if i if i was to blame for that it's like logically i knew i wasn't
Participant: but
Participant: how could i convince myself of that
Participant: um two weeks after she died i wound up with
Participant: pulmonary embolisms
Participant: in one in each lung because i didn't take care of myself for a year and i figured oh i'm thirty years old if
Participant: you know whatever i do to myself i can get over no <laughter> turns out no <laughter> but um
Participant: i mean i wound up having to take more medication
Participant: because of that
Participant: uh it's been a fight to get my own health back to get to be able to
Participant: get out of that depression 'cause so much of my life was based on being my mother's daughter all of a sudden i didn't it's like
Participant: the rug was pulled out my like bottom fell out of my world after that so
Ellie: yeah
Participant: that was the prilly pretty much sent me into a deep depression um i almost got divorced because of it because i just didn't want anything anymore
Participant: so
Participant: and i was i being really distant from my husband by then at that time we were married for about two years at that point and i started getting very distant from him just pushing everything away just
Participant: you know figuring well what am i gonna do with the rest of my life now
Participant: and it
Participant: it's been
Participant: a fight you know you mean there times when no i couldn't get up
Participant: just stay in bed and sleep all day you know
Participant: but then
Participant: realizing that
Participant: when my mother died i had four cats to look after two are mine two are hers and so i wound up adopting the two that were hers i mean well
Participant: they don't have a choice of whether they can go out and get their own food and get their own you know own own supplies
Ellie: uh huh
Participant: i took that responsibility of doing it for them
Participant: so that was one motivating factor was that they didn't have a choice of whether or not i was gonna get up and provide for them i mean i could go without eating i could go without taking care of myself but they couldn't
Ellie: yeah
Participant: they didn't you know so
Participant: they eh they actually got me up and
Participant: and made me go out and face things even though i didn't want to didn't just didn't just kinda wanted to curl up and die but that would've been my choice not theirs and they i mean what would happen to them
Participant: if i wasn't there to take care of them they would've been
Participant: you know sent to a shelter or whatever probably
Participant: and maybe they would've not been readopt me home and adopted by somebody else maybe they would have been killed for
Participant: for me i mean for me making selfish decisions
Ellie: mhm
Participant: so it's like i need somebody to take care of to get myself out of bed <laughter> so <s> and that's actually been a motivating factor is
Participant: to to 'cause i've figured out that if it was just me i'd be able to live without a lot of stuff i mean i would be able to live in my car if i wanted it wouldn't be a big deal i wouldn't care
Participant: as long as i was doing what i wanted with my life but
Participant: i have a family to look after now
Participant: so i have to go out and do things
Ellie: yeah
Participant: you know i i have to go out and look for legitimate work you know day you know day job i have to you know
Participant: but i'm trying to strike a balance between the two because it's what i wanna do with my life but yet i have to take care of my family so i'm
Participant: been working on on a balance of the two
Ellie: how hard is that
Participant: very <laughter> but it's worth it
Participant: i mean
Participant: it would be very i'd have a lot less things to worry about if i just lived in my car and said forget it <laughter>
Participant: but keeping
Participant: a residence down paying bills things like that
Participant: it's it's difficult but you have to do it you know if you want you want anything <anyth> if you ever want anything in your life you have to go through that
Ellie: yeah
Participant: and i and and i know that
Participant: but
Participant: it it gets hard sometimes you do wanna give up
Participant: but then
Participant: it's like well what's the alternative
Participant: i mean i don't think i could live a comfortable life
Participant: 'cause if i did i wouldn't do anything <laughter> i have to be slightly uncomfortable or i'm not gonna do anything with myself i'm just gonna
Participant: be content to just hang out all day stay in bed hang out with my cats or whatever
Participant: and i wouldn't get anything done
Ellie: i see
Ellie: how have you been feeling lately
Participant: uh very
Participant: anxious and nervous and i mean what if
Participant: i don't find
Participant: enough you know enough work to be able to pay my rent or whatever what if um
Participant: you know what what if i can't
Participant: keep
Participant: a semblance of stability in my life and it it's actually hard work to be stable <laughter> and i know it's hard work to be stable but
Participant: what you know it's just eh a lot of what ifs
Participant: and and i don't think it's things that haven't happened and it's stupid and pointless to worry about things that haven't happened and i know that
Participant: but it still happens <ha> it still creeps in
Participant: so that's actually
Participant: a source of
Participant: anxiety
Participant: but then you try to let the anxiety go by getting things done figuring things out making a solid plan and going for it
Participant: but i i i know it it's a cycle
Ellie: that's good
Participant: and i'll go from being really anxious and oh my god what am i gonna do what am i gonna do to saying okay what is
Participant: the fundamental thing i need to take of here
Participant: i mean what <wha> what is just extraneous and what can <c> what can what
Participant: is what are the actual non issues and what is the actual issue
Ellie: mhm
Participant: and so
Participant: figure out how to figure things out that way and then the anxiety starts to go away a little bit
Participant: but then something'll pop up and the what ifs will come up again
Participant: mm i'll have to
Participant: uh
Participant: figure it out again <laughter> but i know it's a cycle i know um what seems huge on the surface when you start chipping away at it
Participant: you get over it pretty quickly you get through it
Ellie: yes
Ellie: when was the last time you felt really happy
Participant: the last time i felt really happy
Participant: i don't know
Participant: zz
Participant: um
Participant: i
Participant: huh <laughter> that's a good question that actually <ac> that actually surprisingly stumped me
Participant: because i do feel happy sometimes sometimes not so much sometimes just kinda
Participant: eh in the middle
Participant: um
Participant: really like overjoyously happy i don't know
Participant: i i'm not i can't think of <o> of when that happened
Ellie: okay
Ellie: how would your best friend describe you
Participant: i don't know you don't know
Participant: perceptions of other people i mean
Participant: probably as somebody who
Participant: oddly enough somebody who is laid back and you know
Participant: handles things as they come but i don't see myself as that
Participant: at all
Participant: and it's a it
Ellie: what would you say are some of your best qualities
Participant: probably that i can think on my feet and
Participant: i'm not afraid to
Participant: hussle my butt off and do whatever i have to to survive and get things done
Participant: um that
Participant: and i can do it creatively and i try to
Participant: strive for balance
Participant: probably
Participant: probably the best things about me <laughter>
Ellie: uh huh
Ellie: that's great
Ellie: what are you most proud of in your life
Participant: that i'm doing basically what i want with my life which even though it's not all easy it's not
Participant: um
Participant: you know i'm not financially well off or anything it's still a lot more than a lot of people can say about their lives 'cause i have an aunt that i really don't talk to
Participant: who and the reason why i don't talk to her is because she's always miserable i mean she's got
Participant: a career that she
Participant: it's more of a job that she fell into
Participant: 'cause my older aunt uh loves animals but didn't wanna be a veterinarian so she became a dog groomer
Ellie: uh huh
Participant: and she was actually really good at it she had a stable business for a long time
Participant: but her hands <ha> you know she started getting arthritis in her hands and
Participant: she had um the actually my cousin's father went and kinda
Participant: stole all the money from her business so she lost her business
Participant: and she kinda she retired early 'cause between that and the arthritis she wound up retiring early
Ellie: uh oh
Participant: she employed my younger aunt who was still a dog groomer but she hates it
Participant: and it's like change your life if you hate your life so much change it
Ellie: yeah
Participant: and the thing <thi> the thing i'm most proud of is
Participant: yeah i'm not as financially well off as she is but i'm doing what i want with my life you know i can
Participant: be creative i can have creative people around me people who i actually like to talk to around me
Participant: people i actually like in my life and
Participant: be happy with that
Participant: and i see a lot of people who aren't
Participant: and it it gives me a sense of of maybe a a bloated sense of self satisfaction to be able to say i'm not like that
Ellie: yeah
Participant: and i'm actually doing what i want even though there's sacrifices i'm still fundamentally doing what i want with my life now
Ellie: mhm
Ellie: that's so good to hear
Ellie: okay i think i've asked everything i need to
Participant: thank you <laughter>
Participant: okay
Ellie: thanks for sharing your thoughts with me
Participant: thank you <laughter>
Ellie: goodbye
Participant: goodbye
