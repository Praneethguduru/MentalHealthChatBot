Participant: she
Participant: um
Participant: you know i i didn't meet 'em according to to what she wanted and and and she became angry and so from my perspective i was doing what she wanted

Participant: um my wife didn't feel that way
Participant: and
Participant: i
Participant: i i just felt very strongly that that was something that we should pursue
Participant: and

Participant: i kinda relinquished <r> relinquished it
Participant: um and i and i said to her you know i'm not gonna make you go um
Participant: you know if if you wanna go then <th> then we'll go but if not then we'll we'll do something else we'll we'll look at at doing something else and not going
Participant: uh and so that that was difficult for me 'cause uh
Participant: you know again that that that kinda felt like a loss 'cause i felt deeply that that's what i was supposed to do
Participant: um
Participant: but then after i kinda gave that up
Participant: then
Participant: um
Participant: then she came to a point where she said no i have a peace about about doing this and then we went ahead and pursued it so
