Participant: there've been a lot of positive um influences in my life i would say my aunt and uh definitely my mother have all been positive influences
Ellie: tell me more about that
Participant: well um i look i look <l> i uh <clears throat> look up to my aunt um i think she's positive i look up to her
Participant: because obviously we grew up with very similar backgrounds came from very similar neighborhoods and areas and she's very successful um despite the types of things that we've gone through as children
Participant: and um she doesn't let her past define her future uh my mom's overcome so many obstacles as well um she had some challenges with her health but she still tries to be optimistic and she's still tries to
Participant: you know overcome these things and just still live our life despite some physical barriers that she might have so i look up to people who are able to
Participant: you know not allow their current situation to dictate their future because anything is possible
Ellie: yeah
Ellie: that's great

Participant: felt sad sometimes
Participant: like i wanted to cry a lot
Ellie: i'm sorry
Ellie: how have you been feeling lately
Participant: i've been feeling okay
Participant: um there are days yeah um i don't know every day is different so
Participant: i mean today i feel fine but like i said everything is differently lately i've been feeling um more like i can be involved <inv> involved in my own life and like i wanna get
Participant: out and do more things
Ellie: yeah
Ellie: have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately
Participant: um
Participant: no no it's no no i haven't
Participant: not any different from
Participant: before what i was experiencing before
Ellie: do you still go to therapy now
Participant: no
Ellie: why did you stop
Participant: mm
Participant: well mm i was receiving um
Participant: uh i guess psychotherapy and um
Participant: i don't know a lot of things happened i moved for a while to go take care of my grandmother and i just kinda
Participant: got more involved in taking care of other people instead of myself for a while
Ellie: that sounds really hard
Participant: uh sometimes
Ellie: do you feel like therapy's useful
Participant: i do
Participant: yes it is
Ellie: how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep
Participant: it's kinda difficult um i either have a hard time falling asleep or a hard time staying asleep
Ellie: are they triggered by something
Participant: i'm sure it is i just don't know what it is as of yet because i you know <sniffle> usually it's um thoughts continual thoughts running through my mind
Participant: that either keep me up or make it hard for me to uh go asleep or make it hard for me to stay asleep
Ellie: mhm
Participant: mhm
Ellie: how do you cope with them
Participant: um journal sometimes uh that might help if i can write some things down and get it out that helps
Participant: other than that i don't you know i haven't found any really great ways of coping
Ellie: i see
Participant: it
Ellie: what are you like when you don't sleep well
Participant: tired <laughter>
Participant: yeah mostly uh tired um
Participant: kinda confused
Ellie: okay
Ellie: when was the last time you felt really happy
Participant: i don't know for the most part i feel happy it's just um
Participant: last time i felt really happy was i guess over the holidays
Ellie: i'd love to hear all about it
Participant: uh i don't know i guess the just being around uh family and friends just the holiday season i guess in general that's just a happy time for me
Participant: and seeing people i haven't seen in a while um
Participant: that's about it
Ellie: okay
Ellie: how would your best friend describe you
Participant: how would my best friend describe me probably as um
Participant: quiet sometimes cautious talkative sometimes um tenacious
Participant: um i don't know a lot of my friends say that they look up to me for uh some of my accomplishments and
Participant: they also say that they are grateful to have me as a friend because i'm caring and compassionate or
Participant: um easy to talk to um
Participant: that i remind them of a of <o> feel like a sister to them
Ellie: aw
Ellie: that's great
Participant: <laughter>
Ellie: is there anything you regret
Participant: um everyone has regrets i'm sure yeah i regret stuff
Ellie: what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago
Participant: to just
Participant: relax and be yourself and just go ahead and it sounds cliche and i don't mean to sound that way but it's true it's just um you have to learn how to be comfortable with you and relax and just know you um to not compare yourself to other people
Participant: because what someone else is doing or where they may be in their life at a certain time is not necessarily where you
Participant: are supposed to be or what you're supposed to be doing at that time it doesn't mean that you're less competent or less able to do it it just means that everyone has their path and everyone has their
Participant: their time and their progression to how they get to things so i would tell me ten years ago to just
Participant: believe in me and stay on my own path for what it is that i want for my life and don't be
Ellie: yeah
Participant: yeah
Ellie: that makes sense
Ellie: tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed
Participant: um really enjoyed working with um well
Participant: okay
Participant: a science project <laughter> with um my younger uh relatives my cousins we did a science project together and it was fun despite the mess we made it was a ball
Ellie: awesome
Ellie: what are you most proud of in your life
Participant: um being the first to attend college in my family
Participant: and then um going to college and coming back to the community where i uh went to school and then teaching in that community and volunteering in that community and helping um youth or children that come from the same background that i came from so
Participant: uh i'm most proud of being able to
Participant: have the opportunity to improve and better myself and then to come back and
Participant: help someone else improve and better themself as well
Ellie: that sounds like a great situation
Ellie: okay i think i've asked everything i need to
Ellie: thanks for sharing your thoughts with me
Ellie: goodbye
Participant: goodbye
