Participant: and um
Participant: i uh i inherited some money i was a little bit careless with it
Participant: and i just kinda had a vibe you know that uh nothing would go wrong kinda a little bit of naitivity <nait> naitivity
Participant: and um unfortunately i made some bad
Participant: financial decisions it kinda put me in a bad
Participant: position for the rest of my life unfortunately um because of a medical conditions i have it's hard for me to rebound and you know make it all up

Participant: and uh he's got his own problems
Participant: so we don't really get into too deep of a conversation
Participant: and other than him it's really there's not really anybody else i have
Participant: so it did it probably makes me a little bit depressed 'cause i don't really feel
Participant: i have anybody i can really count on or really confide in
Ellie: downer (okay)
Ellie: easy_sleep (how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep)

Participant: my well being psychologically too and i think some of the
Participant: the answers said that they
Participant: advise that i see a psychologist or a psychiatrist
Participant: i didn't follow that
Participant: up on that because
Participant: of philosophical differences

Participant: it was anaheim it was a natural products expo so it was pretty nice we uh
Participant: we had some nice meals afterwards there was a lot of exhibiters

Ellie: Ellie17Dec2012_07 (what would you say are some of your best qualities)

Participant: i tend to be
Participant: pretty calm for the most part
Ellie: mhm (mhm)
Ellie: regret (is there anything you regret)
Participant: um
Participant: what do i regret
Participant: well can you elaborate that <laughter>
Ellie: mind (whatever comes to your mind)
Participant: uh well um
Participant: i just well just overall um
Participant: i regret uh
Participant: not being a little more assertive in in my earlier
Participant: uh earlier life um
Participant: and kinda put myself in this position
Participant: it's going kinda goes back to my financial decisions that was sort of that's sort of like my albatross in my life
Participant: i made some bad decisions and unfortunately
Participant: i have to kinda pay the price for now so i kind of like
Participant: sort of like
Participant: living sort of a pauper existence right now which is kinda kinda depressing
Participant: so i would say that's probably what i regret most of all
Ellie: mm (mm)
Ellie: advice_back (what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago)
Participant: well i'd say to really you know analyze kinda go with what you really feel um
Participant: i think
Participant: i was going with other people's opinion other people's advice
Participant: i was kinda going away from
Participant: my basic
Participant: beingness you know like the way i really felt
Participant: like for example i'd make i would do aggressive
Participant: uh investing which if it turned out good it would've been like sort of like winning the lotto i would've been
Participant: well off for the rest of my life <laughter>
Ellie: yeah2 (yeah)
Participant: but unfortunately it went the opposite way
Participant: too too many eggs in that basket
Participant: so i kinda regretted going with
Participant: my gut feeling and and let other people influence me
Participant: and uh
Participant: 'cause by nature i'm a conservative person so i should really do more concervative investments
Participant: in other areas my life i tend to be more conservative but i kinda made some
Participant: aggressive financial <f> financial decisions so that's pretty much
Participant: kinda it always goes back to that area as far as what i regret
Ellie: right2 (right)
Participant: yeah
Ellie: ideal_weekendC (tell me how you spend your ideal weekend)
Participant: wow
Participant: that's interesting uh well i've been doing a lot on weekends so <laughter>
Participant: <laughter> well
Participant: i do like like to be profitable uh i like to do something where i can actually
Participant: you know make money that's sort of like my bread and butter time 'cause i do tradeshows
Participant: but if i'm not doing that then i like to maybe watch some um
Participant: you know i'd like to
Participant: go to entertainment maybe go to a ball game
Participant: uh go to a movie
Participant: go out with some friends
