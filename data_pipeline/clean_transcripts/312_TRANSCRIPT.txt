Participant: not the people well some of the people stuff like that some people
Ellie: <laughter>
Participant: okay i'm cutting you off
Ellie: do you travel a lot
Participant: not as much as i used to
Ellie: why
Participant: um i used to be in school i used to travel a lot of places for conferences and things like that but i'm not in school right now but later on i'll get back into school and i'll travel more but right no doubt
Ellie: what do you enjoy about traveling
Participant: i don't
Participant: i don't enjoy traveling
Ellie: what'd you study at school
Participant: uh that's a good question you're actually pretty good um i studied physics and aerospace engineering but physics mainly
Ellie: are you still working in that
Participant: yes i am actually
Ellie: what do you do now
Participant: right now i teach community college physics and astronomy uh but i still do research in physics also because i like that type of thing and i'm going back to grad school hopefully that's why i'm nervous sometimes on the questionnaire
Ellie: awesome
Participant: impressive
Ellie: what's your dream job
Participant: professor at a place like u_s_c or u_c or l_a or like that
Participant: where the professors do three hours of work a week and the grad students do the rest
Ellie: <laughter>
Participant: you're actually pretty good at this
Ellie: who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life
Participant: <sigh> i there's a lot of people
Participant: the the first one i guess is my physics teacher in a_p physics teacher in high school even though he led me to be an engineer instead of a physics major um he still was a very good influence he told me you know
Participant: he's the first one who taught me that
Participant: school was not about a grade but about learning
Ellie: mhm
Ellie: that's so good to hear
Participant: okay
Ellie: how are you at controlling your temper
Participant: i'm pretty good i think
Ellie: when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
Participant: i'm single so i don't get in many arguments um but it's probably my brother about
Participant: he always like to uh play a video game together i know i'm pretty old to play video games but they're actually pretty good
Participant: um it's probably something like that and me getting angry at him and him trying to defend himself and me being right that's all
Ellie: okay
Ellie: how close are you to your family
Participant: fairly close um
Participant: i see them pretty
Participant: pretty often parents i see a couple times a week
Participant: they're getting older so i've been helping with groceries things like that
Participant: and my brother i see
Participant: same same with him same amount <amo> same time my sister i tutor her kids my nephews uh so i see 'em about once a week also
Ellie: aw
Ellie: that's good
Participant: interesting
Ellie: do you consider yourself an introvert
Participant: yes
Ellie: why
Participant: because i spend long periods of time doing math and reading
Participant: and not talking to anybody that's introverted
Ellie: i see what you mean
Ellie: what do you do to relax
Participant: i guess i play video games or and i work out i work out i think a lot
Participant: i try to at least
Ellie: cool
Ellie: what do you do when you're annoyed
Participant: i roll my eyes which i've been told is a bad thing
Participant: um
Participant: and that's about it i think
Ellie: okay
Ellie: what do you think of today's kids
Participant: <deep breath>
Participant: bad parenting
Participant: basically parents are more self-centered more to themselves unlike previous generations and the kids just
Participant: do what they want because the parents aren't there for <fo> the parents aren't being parents in my personal <per> own personal opinion
Ellie: mm
Ellie: that makes sense
Ellie: what's one of your most memorable experiences
Participant: <sigh>
Participant: um
Participant: i guess
Participant: scrubbed_entry
Participant: um
Participant: scrubbed_entry
Participant: scrubbed_entry
Ellie: awesome
Participant: thank you
Ellie: how would your best friend describe you
Participant: i don't really have a best friend
Participant: introverted remember
Ellie: okay
Ellie: what would you say are some of your best qualities
Participant: i'm biased obviously
Participant: but they are
Participant: i'm really good in math
Participant: i'm not really sure if you can't not saying you can't get better than me in math but thing is
Participant: it's just that you get reach a certain confidence with it where no matter what it is you need to learn in math you can always figure it out um i am patient i think
Participant: and i am disciplined where i can spend i can spend many hours many many many hours reading books that might not be important but they might be important so i have to do it anyway
Participant: that type of thing
Ellie: what are some things that usually put you in a good mood
Participant: when i a good workout
Participant: doing well in video games small little things like that
Participant: um
Participant: what's really happy is when my my research type thing mathematical or physics type thing when it goes well that must puts me in a mood <mo> that puts me in a good mood
Ellie: nice
Participant: thank you
Ellie: what are you most proud of in your life
Participant: right now
Participant: it's the fact that
Participant: research that i did i did make it this far
Participant: research wise that's all
Participant: that's all
Ellie: tell me more about that
Participant: interesting um
Participant: when you start off in school
Participant: you read about einstein and things like that it's he's this general xxx hero particle physics and you have no idea what it is and you know it's very complicated things like quantum mechanics
Participant: and
Participant: you still haven't realized you're interested in that and but you're not sure if you can actually make it
Participant: and eventually each step as a lot of time goes by you wish you
Participant: as time goes on you can get closer and closer eventually make the goal eventually you realize you are just not as good as einstein but you are up there you can do research in physics you can add to mass knowledge in science and that's impressive that you you don't see yourself doing that when you're a kid
Ellie: yeah
Participant: okay
Ellie: when was the last time you felt really happy
Participant: um
Participant: a few weeks ago when i got a good grade in a class
Ellie: cool
Participant: thank you
Ellie: have you ever served in the military
Participant: yes briefly
Participant: many years ago <ag> yes
Ellie: really
Ellie: why'd you decide to enlist in the military
Participant: i don't know it just always growing up i always thought that was i always thought it was my dream when i was a kid that's why and i just went about doing that
Ellie: how old were you when you joined the military
Participant: um i was a national guard i think about eighteen nineteen
Participant: i got commissioned at twenty twenty one and i was only in for about a year so i left at twenty twenty two
Ellie: you were very young weren't you
Participant: yes
Participant: not really
Ellie: how did serving in the military change you
Participant: i don't think it did i think it's just something that you grew up something about <abo> something i grew up already expecting to be so it didn't change me as much
Ellie: mm
Ellie: what did you do after the military
Participant: graduate school
Participant: in physics
Ellie: okay
Ellie: have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d
Participant: no
Ellie: have you been diagnosed with depression
Participant: nope
Ellie: how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep
Participant: it depends if i workout really hard the night before <bef> the day the day before
Participant: if workout pretty hard it's bad but if i don't workout it i don't know just eh it's hard
Participant: i guess moderately
Ellie: that makes sense
Participant: thank you
Ellie: do you feel that way often
Participant: yes
Ellie: i'm sorry
Participant: it's okay
Ellie: what are you like when you don't sleep well
Participant: i'm probably like i am now
Participant: normal i think not as not as happy about everything  but still pretty okay i can still function
Ellie: uh huh
Ellie: have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately
Participant: no
Participant: maybe slightly
Ellie: okay
Participant: sorry
Participant: no
Participant: yes
Participant: yes i have changes in my thoughts
Ellie: okay
Ellie: tell me more about that
Participant: um applying to grad school again it's been awhile and slightly apprehensive happy that it's looks good but apprehensive that it might not be good and things like that
Ellie: how hard is that
Participant: what do you mean by that in case i know this is a computer but as in how hard is it to deal with these thoughts or how hard is it to go into grad school
Ellie: yes
Participant: i understand
Ellie: why don't we talk about that later
Participant: okay
Participant: i agree
Ellie: okay
Ellie: is there anything you regret
Participant: no not really
Ellie: what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago
Participant: probably keep doing what you're doing even though i'm not that old believe it or not um
Participant: twenty years ago i was probably fifteen no no yeah yeah it was fifteen
Participant: um just keep doing what you're doing i think i i was very lucky and fortunate way it worked out if i worked if it was a little bit different i don't think it'd worked out so well
Participant: even though it's not perfect now i think i'm doing really well personally
Ellie: mm
Ellie: i understand
Participant: thank you
Ellie: thanks it was great chatting with you
Participant: same here
Ellie: goodbye
Participant: goodbye
