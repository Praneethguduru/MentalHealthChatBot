Participant: no
Participant: not at all
Ellie: why
Participant: just don't

Participant: i remember my younger brother always
Participant: um joking and saying that i i would talk to anybody and i will i'll talk to just about anybody
Participant: just because i enjoy learning about other people
Ellie: that's good
Ellie: what do you do to relax
Participant: um
Participant: most of the time like by the end of the day after i've cooked dinner and we've had dinner together as a family
Participant: um i there's a word game on the computer that i like to play for a little while and then
Participant: um watch t_v have a cocktail with my husband
Participant: and just relax that's what we do and you know
Participant: 'cause we have a lot going on we don't stay up too late so
Participant: i like to watch crime dramas
Ellie: nice
Ellie: what are some things that make you really mad
Participant: um
Participant: really mad probably not a lot um
Participant: i get frustrated with for example my daughter does not clean up her room
Participant: almost ever
Participant: so that that gets me angry but um
Participant: in terms of like really um
Participant: getting like heatedly angry i mean other than like
Participant: little things that my children do to you know
Participant: especially my oldest child who's twenty one
Participant: you know he can be confrontational so
Participant: other than that nothing gets me like really angry
Participant: haven't i haven't haven't felt that
Ellie: okay
Ellie: what's the best thing about being a parent
Participant: um contributing to society helping uh
Participant: helping
Participant: to raise um responsible people i guess um
Participant: and of course the love and the affection and the um
Participant: the fun and the excitement that goes with it of all the stages that go
Participant: i mean like really right now i'm in a stage where my children
Participant: are either adults or teenagers i only have i have one eleven year old and the rest are all teenagers and adults
Participant: so it's really fun because we're able to um talk about current events and
Participant: all kinds of stuff that's going on in the world and you know have have uh
Participant: challenging discussions and that sort of thing
Participant: so it's it's a different level than when you're taking care of babies and
Participant: you know changing diapers and that kind of stuff
Ellie: uh huh
Ellie: what's the hardest thing about being a parent
Participant: the hardest thing is that it's twenty four seven
Participant: um
Participant: you're never not a parent
Participant: you know it's and so you have to accept that and that's i remember when i first
Participant: with my first child um
Participant: thinking you know when i brought him home from the hospital this is it i mean there's no going back you you cannot
Participant: um change i mean i guess you could if you did something horrible but
Participant: i mean under normal circumstances you can't change um that and it's a permanent thing and
Participant: um
Participant: it it it uh
Participant: in some ways it takes away your freedom but in other ways it give you a different sort of freedom
Ellie: i see what you mean
Ellie: there are always tradeoffs in life aren't there
Participant: mhm
Participant: always
Ellie: who's someone that's been a positive influence in  your life
Participant: i'm sorry
Participant: i didn't get what you said
Ellie: what are some things you like to do for fun who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life
Participant: um some of the things that've been a positive influence in my life most importantly my church
Participant: um and my faith
Participant: uh but also my husband he's been a really um
Participant: he's kind of he's very
Participant: like logical thinking and very you know grounded
Participant: so when if i get emotional or i get upset about something he's always
Participant: we balance each other out likewise if he's upset about something i'm able to balance him out
Participant: it's been a that's been a a great gift in my life
Ellie: how are you at controlling your temper
Participant: um i don't i i don't think i'd be categorized as somebody with a a temper
Participant: um occasionally i i occasionally i get angry but i don't like have like
Participant: rarely do i have outbursts um
Participant: i'm more more likely to you know to say what i feel not let it build up
Participant: so with you know like my husband and i don't
Participant: rarely fight like have
Participant: arguments that are
Participant: yelling and screaming or anything like that it almost never happens
Participant: because i i like i said i'm more of a type of person that communicates on the spot so if i'm thinking something
Participant: i usually communicate it right away instead of letting it build up
Ellie: that's good
Ellie: when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
Participant: um usually i'm arguing with my older son because he
Participant: um
Participant: you know he thinks he knows everything
Participant: he's twenty one years old so he has the know it all mentality
Participant: and i'm just telling him that he doesn't know it all and
Participant: you know as life goes on he'll learn more
Participant: he's very confident and very self uh
Participant: self uh what's the word self assured and so he thinks that you know everything he does is correct
Participant: and
Participant: he still has a lot of learning to do that's all
Ellie: that sounds really hard
Participant: mhm
Participant: it is it can be mhm
Ellie: what do you think of today's kids
Participant: i think um
Participant: that many of them are um
Participant: spoiled and live in an environment of uh
Participant: of instant gratification
Participant: um
Participant: which i think is gonna be
Participant: um detrimental to the to the future of this country
Participant: but um
Participant: you know given that with all the technology we have there's really not any way to go back so i
Participant: i have um hope that um
Participant: they will
Participant: i mean i think this country was built on on uh hard work and and ethics
Participant: and uh
Participant: hopefully our our the next generation and the
Participant: the generations after that
Participant: can maintain that um
Participant: that standard of living i don't know if it's possible
Ellie: yeah
Ellie: how would your best friend describe you
Participant: mm as
Participant: loving nurturing um
Participant: funny
Participant: we laugh a lot and um
Participant: caring honest
Participant: things that uh
Participant: i mean my best i have
Participant: well actually my best friend is
Participant: it's two people it's two sisters that i grew up with and um
Participant: we
Participant: i
Participant: for some years
Participant: took care of their mother who has alzheimers before my parents got sick so i had a very close
Participant: have a very close relationship with them still do
Participant: and so um i'm considered the fourth sister
Participant: so i would say that those are my best friends and and um
Participant: we love each other very much
Participant: it's a good relationship
Ellie: aw
Ellie: have you ever served in the military
Participant: no
Ellie: have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d
Participant: no
Ellie: have you been diagnosed with depression
Participant: yes
Participant: most
Ellie: how long ago were you diagnosed
Participant: mostly
Participant: mm minorly depression it was more anxiety
Participant: um probably um
Participant: um it's probably been five or six years i mean i've had if off and on all my life but it was never diagnosed originally
Participant: like as a teenager i think is when i first had started with the anxiety but
Ellie: mhm
Participant: um
Participant: other than that i i you know so
Participant: depression kind of goes with anxiety if it's not under control
Participant: um but now it's under control so
Participant: i have a great
Ellie: are they triggered by something
Participant: huh
Ellie: are they triggered by something
Participant: um no i think it was what they call free [flee] float free floating anxiety more of a of of uh organic
Participant: um reason for it in other words there there was a chemical imbalance
Ellie: oh
Participant: in my brain
Ellie: how have you been feeling lately
Participant: i've been feeling pretty good actually the holidays were great um
Participant: we had a
Participant: good family gatherings
Participant: a little stressed because um
Participant: we're making a big decision right now to help my parents out um my dad is really sick um
Participant: and we've offered to move in with them they have a big home but we would have to do a lot of
Participant: some renovation and some
Participant: to help and some obviously moving around
Participant: and so we're in the throws of that and um
Participant: so that's a big big change but i'm looking forward to it because
Participant: really don't want my parents to be alone as they get they're in their eighties
Participant: so as they get closer to death i want to have my family there with them
Ellie: i understand
Ellie: how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep
Participant: um
Participant: not easy usually
Participant: all of my life i think i've always
Participant: i mean i'm not i've always had um
Participant: at least i wake up at least once in the middle of the night
Ellie: why
Participant: um
Participant: to go to the bathroom basically
Ellie: oh
Participant: and uh
Participant: other than that i mean no now i sleep well i mean other than that i sleep well but sometimes if i wake up like really early in the morning
Participant: then i can't go back to sleep  i'll get up and maybe do some work on the computer and then
Participant: go back to bed and
Participant: go back to sleep idepends on what my schedule is and if the kids are
Participant: have to be at the school early and there's a lot of factors
Ellie: that sucks
Participant: yeah sometimes it does
Ellie: what are you like when you don't sleep well
Participant: mm
Participant: probably basically the same i think i might complain a bit like oh i'm tired or my body hurts or whatever you know
Participant: but um
Participant: i think overall probably the same
Participant: my kids know i'll be i'll tell me kids oh i'm really tired and they'll understand my older daughter will be really helpful
Ellie: okay
Participant: they my other daughter will try to cook dinner or something like that so you know
Participant: they may pitch in a little bit more
Ellie: uh huh
Ellie: have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately
Participant: uh not really
Participant: not not no
Participant: not really
Participant: not anything significant
Ellie: do you feel like therapy is useful
Participant: huh
Ellie: do you feel like therapy is useful
Participant: um actually yes i do
Participant: i do feel like therapy is useful
Ellie: tell me more about that
Participant: um well uh we had a situation with my daughter
Participant: um
Participant: she also suffers from anxiety and
Participant: um we have had her in therapy for some time and we just recently we're about to finish
Participant: a group with her that was a six month um
Participant: uh
Participant: group for d_b_t it's called and it's like a
Participant: it's the first time they it's the first time they're documenting using it with teenagers
Participant: and um
Participant: it's been really good it's been
Participant: very helpful it's just all about
Participant: how to live in the moment and how to you know actual physical and mental
Participant: um strategies to keep your uh keep you from
Participant: your mind from going crazy you know worrying about things or you know
Participant: in this case some of the kids have tried to harm themselves or whatever so
Participant: um
Participant: that's the focus of the therapy and it's been really good my husband and i both have been going with our daughter
Participant: and it's been really um
Participant: really informational and really helpful i think
Ellie: that's so good to hear
Ellie: what got you to seek help
Participant: oh my daughter was um she was
Participant: in a bad way she was you know suffering a lot and
Participant: we knew it and um
Participant: we acted on it that's all
Ellie: that's great
Ellie: when was the last time you felt really happy
Participant: um
Participant: like
Participant: really joyful and happy i would say probably
Participant: when
Participant: probably it would be in israel when we renewed our marriage vows in the the at the in knaan
Ellie: aw
Participant: uh so um you know where the wedding of kana took place that was really moving and beautiful
Participant: um and it was it happened that our anniversary was
Participant: we left on our anniversary day flew to israel
Participant: so it was right at the same time
Participant: it was beautiful
Ellie: wow
Participant: very meaningful
Participant: and other than that i would say you know like
Participant: uh other joyful occasions have been you know like christmas and you know family gatherings and
Participant: you know my dad's birthday turned eighty three
Participant: on christmas eve you know that kinda thing so
Ellie: what are some things that usually put you in a good mood
Participant: um
Participant: um that's an interesting question i would say
Participant: um
Participant: once i get like things done that i need to do like if i'm
Participant: have a lot of chores [ch] a lot of either work to do around the house or
Participant: errands to run once i get them done
Participant: i feel like a sense of accomplishment
Participant: you know much like i mean i worked for many years in a as an administrative manager at u_c_l_a and um
Participant: you know once you get a project done or you get your whatever month end stuff done or if there's a lot of different things
Participant: you have to meet deadlines there's uh that feeling of like yeah i got it done you know
Participant: so i think that would be you know for me the most um
Participant: most recent
Participant: um
Participant: way of feeling good and feeling you know
Participant: like feeling accomplished
Ellie: mhm
Ellie: what's your dream job
Participant: dream job hm
Participant: i think i've already lived it i'm also a birth doula
Participant: and um
Ellie: really
Participant: yeah and um
Participant: so i've attended a lot of births and now i really only do it for family and friends
Participant: and um it's the most rewarding thing you could possibly ask to be involved in
Participant: the birth the bringing of new life into this world so
Participant: i would say that's probably
Participant: was my was a dream job and i didn't know it
Participant: i trained much after you know i did my managerial stuff and um
Participant: was awesome it is and was awesome so i don't work at at a hospital anymore
Participant: actually the hospital that i worked at is now closed
Participant: but um
Participant: i like i said i do it for family members
Ellie: what made you decide to do that
Participant: um
Participant: i attended a friend of mine's birth by accident
Participant: she uh she had had the same o_b as i did with all my children
Participant: and um
Participant: i came to bring food for her husband when she was in labor we were you know close friends
Participant: and
Participant: her labor picked up quite a bit when i got there you know she wanted me to stay she didn't want me to leave
Participant: i hadn't planned on it so that was the first birth that i had attended outside of you know myself giving birth
Participant: which is a whole different experience
Participant: so after that i was really interesting interested in possibly study un nurse midwifery
Ellie: uh huh
Participant: but then i discovered this thing called being a doula which is really gives you
Participant: even a lot more hands on uh one on one contact with the patient which is what i like
Participant: so i trained to do that at at a hospital in inglewood
Participant: um about fifteen years ago
Participant: 'cause my son is fifteen and he was a year old no sixteen he was a year old
Participant: so um
Participant: yeah
Participant: and i've been
Ellie: how hard is that
Participant: um
Participant: well it can be challenging in terms of hours it depends on how long the woman's in labor but
Participant: uh and you know also like
Participant: for me i always tell my friends and family if they want me to be their doula that i cannot guarantee a hundred percent i'm not doing it for business
Participant: and that way and because of that i don't have like back up doulas that in case i'm sick or unavailable somebody else can fill in for me
Participant: so um but so far it's been that all the women that've asked me i've been able to be there for some reason so the
Participant: um
Participant: the uh the only one that i missed was one a friend of mine from church she wanted me to go with her second baby
Participant: i was with her for her first but the labor went so fast she didn't even call me [laughter]
Participant: it was in the middle of the night she was like
Ellie: wow
Participant: two hours of labor she wouldn't even if she had called me i wouldn't have been there in time [laughter]
Participant: so um
Ellie: [laughter]
Participant: it went really fast but other than that
Participant: you know um
Participant: yeah i've been been been able to attend all the births of people that have asked me to do
Ellie: what's one of your most memorable experiences
Participant: um
Participant: in all of life or in your job
Ellie: whatever comes to your mind
Participant: uh probably my my own birth
Participant: i mean my the birth of my own children
Ellie: how did you feel in that moment
Participant: um
Participant: like there's an extreme
Participant: sense of joy excitement relief
Participant: because of course you're out of the pain
Participant: and then like it's just it's just a matter of you know
Participant: going forward from there but it's
Participant: it's like something you can't explain it's it's just it's awesome
Participant: after you give birth
Ellie: that sounds like a great situation
Participant: and i have experienced both ways i've done both um
Participant: natural and
Participant: my last child was via c_section so i've had both
Participant: both um experiences
Ellie: mhm
Ellie: is there anything you regret
Participant: um
Participant: i with my third child i had kind of a crazy nurse she was a little
Participant: psychotic but other than that we laugh about it now but when i was in labor it wasn't funny
Ellie: [laughter]
Participant: and um she
Participant: she was not there when the doctor i mean it was my my third child was
Participant: born very quickly after he broke the water and oof
Participant: my husband was there but she was not nor was the doctor and she got in a lot of trouble
Participant: because i only had like two contractions after that
Ellie: oh no
Participant: my daughter was born in the bed
Participant: so for me it was great 'cause i didn't have to go through any of the labor but
Participant: um i'm sure they weren't happy
Participant: to fill out a lot of paper work after that
Ellie: yeah
Participant: so
Ellie: what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago
Participant: now would i give mysef for ten or twenty years ago
Participant: um
Participant: ten or twenty years ago i was probably more
Participant: not as um
Participant: relaxed not as um
Participant: like i feel now at my age that um
Participant: i i don't have the same concerns that i did then i don't worry about
Participant: uh i don't worry at all about what people think about me i don't worry at all about what
Participant: you know
Participant: you know like my i noticed my daughter's oh mom you can't wear that because people are gonna say this i just say i don't care
Participant: you know but they do because it's still in their frame of mind that that oh mom you have to dress like this and dress like that whatever
Participant: so that would probably be it the wisdom that you you achieve with age that
Participant: you you see how life there are so many things that are more important in life than worrying about little things
Ellie: that makes sense
Participant: what are you most proud of in your life
Participant: most proud of um
Participant: probably my family my my husband and my
Participant: my children i mean the fact that we've stayed married that we've
Participant: we're an in tact family that
Participant: um
Participant: my kids see every day how
Participant: their friends suffer who come from divorced families or single parents and
Participant: they um
Participant: they actually express
Participant: gratitude sometimes that we are married and we still you know we are still a family
Participant: so i would say that's probably it
Ellie: that's great
Ellie: what would you say are some of your best qualities
Participant: um
Participant: probably the
Participant: one of my best qualities is
Participant: uh
Participant: being able to listen to people and being able to um
Participant: not be judgmental um
Participant: through the years i've had a
Participant: a lot of experience with um
Participant: people with problems a lot of friends with problems people i know from church and
Participant: it's just taught me that um
Participant: everybody has weaknesses everybody has problems
Participant: and um i don't think i'm better than someone else
Participant: if you think you're better than someone else then that's usually um to me a sign that you don't know yourself well enough
Ellie: yeah
Ellie: thanks for sharing your thoughts with me
Participant: okay
Ellie: okay i think i've asked everything i need to
Participant: okay
Ellie: goodbye
Participant: goodbye
