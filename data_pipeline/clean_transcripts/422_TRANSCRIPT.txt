Participant: and
Participant: i don't know i think
Participant: scrubbed_entry
Participant: and i don't know it's it's it's kind of a tenuous friendship like
Participant: mm she's a good friend in some ways and she's mm we're we're actually kinda distant in other ways so i i don't consider her
Participant: um like someone that i would confide in and you know if any
Participant: deep problems but um
Participant: sometimes we just have
Participant: she's very touchy
Participant: and she doesn't have the same sense of humor i do
Participant: so i think
Participant: she had said some things to me during the night which mm kinda bothered me but mm
Participant: you know i just kinda
Participant: that's just how she is
Participant: and then i guess i said some things that she
Participant: felt were
Participant: eh well she gets really

Participant: then one day she called me up and then we were friends again
Ellie: okay_confirm (okay)

Participant: for like five years
Participant: um
Participant: you know he wasn't like beating me or anything he was a really good guy but we just
Participant: had a lot of um
Participant: we <w> we weren't always on the same wavelength and we did have a lot of like disagreements
Participant: so i had thought about it and thought about it and
Participant: we were already engaged but we had been together for a long time so
Participant: i don't know uh
Participant: i was always it was always on my mind like should i get married or should i not and then finally
Participant: eh we were just always having
Participant: um
Participant: we were always what what's the word i'm looking for um

Ellie: Ellie17Dec2012_03 (that's good)
Ellie: situation_handled (tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently)
Participant: <deep breath> <sigh> hmm um probably leaving my job
Participant: for well to help my friend start a business in nevada
Participant: and when i when i
Participant: i really liked my job i mean it was it was pretty good um it was right over at the beach
Participant: and when i told them that i was leaving then they offered me this huge raise and they offered me a a different position which was awesome
Participant: and that was really stressful for me because um
Participant: i'd already promised my friend <laughter> to leave i wouldn't have gotten the position you know offer if if it wasn't
Participant: for her wanting me to come over there um
Participant: it was really really stressful and i stressed over it for about three weeks until i actually left
Participant: and um
Participant: when i went over there
Participant: like we had we had made agreements about how much they were gonna pay me and blah blah blah
Participant: when i got there everything like she didn't remember telling me that i needed a certain amount and
Participant: the other principals of the company were um
Participant: you know the <th>
Participant: it was a hard situation 'cause she had she had talked with me but they hadn't talked with me and they're like well that's too much
Participant: and also
Participant: they were a different religion
Participant: and it was very strange i mean they were all one religion <laughter> i was i was surrounded by mormons and i i don't have anything against mormons but it was very different because eh
Ellie: wild_laughter5 ((laughter))
Participant: eh i was kind of an outsider there and then
Participant: also the weather was just it was absolutely awful there <laughter>
Participant: so i would say that's one decision it it's
Participant: it just a a pivotal point in my life and i think that um
Participant: i really wish i i had just stayed
Ellie: yeah_downer (yeah)
Ellie: memory_erase (tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory)

Ellie: uh_huh (uh huh)
Participant: mm <sigh>
Participant: can't really think of anything i mean
Participant: even like that
Participant: that bad decision that i made
Participant: you know it it has value in it so <sigh> i can't really say that i would want something erased i mean maybe if i was like raped or something
Ellie: mm (mm)
