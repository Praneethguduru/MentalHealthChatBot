Ellie: yeah3 (yeah)
Ellie: dont_like_LA (what are some things you don't really like about l_a)
Participant: the traffic the cost of living
Participant: um
Participant: sometimes i think it's too big
Participant: and i think the transportation system as far as the bus and trains um is long overdue they need to revamp it or
Participant: you know add more buses and things like that just make it easier for people to get around on public transportation
Ellie: see_mean (i see what you mean)
Ellie: travel_shoes (i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot)
Participant: i travel when i can a little bit here and there i have not been overseas yet which is a goal of mine within the next couple of years
Participant: so i've just traveled domestically i try to take at least one trip a year somewhere
Ellie: thats_good (that's good)
Ellie: travel_changed (what do you enjoy about traveling)
Participant: i just like the fact of getting on the plane and going places um going particularly somewhere i've never been
Participant: and learning about that place you know like so if i'm going to d_c i really look forward to it 'cause it's a historic city
Participant: you know things like that
Ellie: travel_trips (i'd love to hear about one of your trips)
Participant: um my most recent trip would've been d_c <laughter> last year
Participant: um i went to go visit a friend and i stayed about
Participant: three <thr> i think three to four days
Participant: and i got to see the capitol
Participant: um he showed me around showed me all the you know historic landmarks and sites the white house
Participant: the capitol building um i got to see a lot of other different uh government buildings
Participant: and um it was it was a a good experience the irony was i had to fly on nine eleven and so that had me a little uneasy
Participant: but once i was in the plane up in the air i was okay and it was all good and once i was back home i was like yes
Participant: but i i i miss the trip and i look forward to going back
Ellie: nice (nice)
Ellie: memorableB (what's one of your most memorable experiences)
Participant: um attending uh my friend's wedding she had a destination wedding in hawaii
Participant: um
Participant: actually maui
Participant: that was actually two three three years ago three years ago
Participant: in august and um i've been trying to get back ever since and i wanna take my kids and
Participant: i just love it there and i actually kinda look forward to to moving there one day
Ellie: kids_elaborate (tell me about your kids)
Participant: um i have three sons um thirteen-year-old twins
Participant: boys and my youngest is also a boy he's eight
Participant: they um all have birthdays in june the twins are june ninth and my baby is june fourth and so they're just a few days apart but
Participant: five years apart technically
Participant: and they're just super super
Participant: typical boys active all over the place hormones puberty um so it's actually an interesting time because you know the the two older boys are going through puberty
Participant: um they're teenage years
Participant: um my youngest
Participant: um
Participant: still trying to figure some things out for himself you know doing that transition stage of eight to nine years old
Participant: so he'll be nine in june and then my oldest will be fourteen so it's a challenging time for me as well
Ellie: parent_best (what's the best thing about being a parent)
Participant: just the joy of watching what you put into being a parent every day and seeing how
Participant: just with love and nurturing and um
Participant: the right and you know well i can't say proper development but just with
Participant: you know love and nurturing how a um baby grows into a toddler into
Participant: you know a young boy to a teenager and then into a young man and so that experience alone has been rewarding just watching my sons grow up and go through these different stages
Participant: and seeing how they have developed and you know
Participant: seeing some of the things that they're going through now that so reminiscent of my teenage years
Participant: and um it's just it's very rewarding and um actually i look forward to maybe even being a foster parent later down the line when they're older and off in college 'cause i really love children and giving back
Ellie: aw (aw)
Ellie: good_hear (that's so good to hear)
Ellie: parent_hardest (what's the hardest thing about being a parent)
Participant: um
Participant: mm there's probably a couple of things but i would just say
Participant: um
Participant: for me being a single parent is um the financial
Participant: um well i would say that along with some of the emotional with <w> with them having um to bear the brunt of the responsibility of just child child rearing
Participant: um
Participant: you know the
Participant: just the everyday things of what you have to deal with the
Participant: uh sometimes when you're just tired you don't wanna be bothered or you're trying to do things for yourself
Participant: you have to be reminded that oh okay i gotta cook or i have to go pick my son up or i have to take him to baseball practice
Participant: uh this one want to go over here um this one is acting moody and you know just those those types of challenges
Participant: um as well as the financial and you know making sure you know you're able to put food on the table you're paying your rent and
Participant: you know you're keeping up with the day to day and that's those two are probably the hardest things um for me to deal with
Ellie: yeah_downer (yeah)
Ellie: symptoms_cope (how do you cope with them)
Participant: well i just um i take it day by day i just put one foot in front of the other and um
Participant: i'm extremely spiritual so i just rely on god and
Participant: pray a lot and meditate
Participant: um
Participant: if i see i need a little help if if
Participant: you know i'm i'm i'm not above asking for help so sometimes if i have to reach out to people or
Participant: you know see what other resources are out there to help me you know i try to do that and so for me right now my biggest challenge is just
Participant: trying to go back to school to put myself in a better um economic situation so i can continue to provide for them comfortably
Ellie: mhm (mhm)
Ellie: study (what did you study at school)
Participant: um i studied communications actually i was a um journalism public relations major with a minor in sociology
Participant: and now i'm studying business <laughter>
Ellie: change_directions (what made you decide to do that)
Participant: i just thought that you know um
Participant: there would be more opportunities for me with business um as far as jobs
Participant: and then i you know have a desire to go to graduate school so i just figured in the long run it was a better
Participant: um it would put me in a better position give me more opportunities um
Participant: with the communications it's a little limited and especially as you get older um the fields of t_v reporting and things like that um
Participant: are kinda
Participant: become
Participant: you know harder to obtain
Participant: so i just thought eh i would go into something more realistic
Participant: and um
Participant: you know but uh i like both fields i really do i like communicating writing reading talking as you can tell and um so we'll see
Ellie: dream_job (what's your dream job)
Participant: um <laughter> a couple probably but i would say ultimately
Participant: would be traveling like working as like a travel writer um going to different destinations
Participant: um trying different foods out um writing about different people
Participant: cultures um
Participant: learning and living you know uh about those different people and cultures living <l> living amongst <am> amongst the
Participant: you know the the people there and um
Participant: being interactive with the children and stuff like that so i kinda hope to be able to do that one day but yes um
Participant: it it would be something along those lines and then the fallback would be a counselor social worker something in that area
Participant: if i could encompass all three hopefully i can i i would like to do that
Ellie: mhm (mhm)
Ellie: shyoutgoing (do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing)
Participant: um that's actually a hard question probably because i initially grew up very shy
Participant: and um not so much shy as i am reserved now
Participant: um
Participant: but not conservative but just reserved and you know when i go somewhere i'm
Participant: checking everything everybody else out
Participant: and then once i become comfortable or acclimate to the situation then i'm like okay you know i warm up to the to the situation or the people
Participant: but i'm also friendly i can be very friendly and outgoing i like to talk
Participant: um you know
Participant: i seem like a chatterbox but i'm not really so usually if i'm in a big space with a whole lot of people i don't like to be the center of attention <atten> attention i can
Participant: attach myself to one or two people and
Participant: you know become friendly with them but i i overall i am a open friendly person
Ellie: mhm (mhm)
Ellie: relax_fishtank (sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax)
Participant: <laughter>
Participant: um
Participant: for me um it it could be something as simple as just unplugging
Participant: everything all electronics and just sitting for a few moments
Participant: meditating
Participant: praying or reading a good spiritual scripture
Participant: um
Participant: if i'm able to i like to go for a good massage
Participant: maybe get a facial
Participant: um
Participant: you know things that will
Participant: i kinda like the physical part part of it i like massages things that really release tension
Participant: um
Participant: and if not then just like i said just sitting at home reading and praying or
Participant: i like the beach i love the beach so sometimes i drive and go sit by the beach
Participant: i like <li> also like to just maybe
Participant: go and have lunch by myself or get a mani pedi or
Participant: maybe go window shopping you know things like that
Ellie: okay_confirm (okay)
Ellie: control_temper (how are you at controlling your temper)
Participant: mm pretty good sometimes i'm just like grr i don't really have so much a issue with the temper
Participant: as i am i just i'm more impatient
Participant: unfortunately a lot of times with people and you know situations
Participant: so i just can become really irritated or irritable
Participant: um
Participant: quite agitated especially if it's that time of the month for me i just
Participant: lose patience um outside of that
Participant: i'm actually pretty good i try to be very you know conscious of where i'm at and
Participant: be very patient with people especially if i could see that the person is
Participant: like if if they're a new <n> a new checkout person at the the counter or cashier i do try to be
Participant: i do try to be patient and understanding
Participant: 'cause i would want that you know if it were me i would want someone to extend that to me
Ellie: mm (mm)
Participant: um you know with my kids sometimes you know it's this it works both ways too once it's that time of the month i'm just like ugh just leave me alone
Participant: um or i might have a short temper or a short fuse
Participant: so i am conscious of it i try to be
Participant: aware of it and and try to monitor it but you know like anybody i'm human and there are times or i have my days or moments when i could just like ugh go off and
Participant: just lose it
Ellie: yeah3 (yeah)
Ellie: last_argument (when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about)
Participant: um <sigh>
Participant: well i haven't really had it not per se an argument but there's been a ongoing thing with american express so i would say
Participant: because it was not a personal
Participant: contact
Participant: but a company i eh we
Participant: it it really was an argument but uh you know i i had some um issues with american express i had to call in about on i think saturday and i kept um i wasn't getting the
Participant: response i expected and so i would get the whole contact the call was just back and forth
Participant: very frustrating and i was upset and you know the rep was trying to overtalk me then i was trying to overtalk her
Participant: so you <y> you know i don't know if you would consider that an argument but i would definitely say that's the last time when you know
Participant: i just kinda like reached my boiling point
Participant: to say the least and was really upset and
Participant: eh that <th> that was the closest you know to an argument and then i had to call back this morning that one didn't really escalate to an argument
Participant: but it was um a a a tense exchange for a minute or two
Ellie: isee_downer (i see)
Ellie: situation_handled (tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently)
Participant: probably the most recent contact and that would've been the one on saturday with american express
Participant: um
Participant: or actually it was on sunday yeah and um
Participant: i know
Participant: the person was trying to help me but you know when you you're constantly being told different things and i've had to call in about five or six times about the same situation
Participant: and it not be resolved it just takes you there so
Participant: um
Participant: just i kept raising my voice said some things i shouldn't had um
Participant: and just was more so allowed myself to lose control of the contact i like to really feel in control of the contact
Participant: and so um it just took me there my blood pressure was raised
Participant: <clears throat> excuse me and that was just a kind of a mess for a while for like maybe thirty minutes or an hour after that
Participant: just irritable and agitated and upset and and so i always try to you know
Participant: go back and
Participant: pull from those and
Participant: you know do my own sense of feedback and
Participant: see how i could you know handle things differently but that's one i i definitely wish i could've kept my cool and been more level-headed and
Participant: and not really raised my voice and you know um been more polite
Ellie: okay_confirm (okay)
Ellie: hard_decisionB (tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make)
Participant: <sigh>
Participant: mm
Participant: well i've probably have had a couple but <clears throat> probably the most is a situation years ago when i just had my sons and they probably my twins they were probably about two
Participant: and i was in a situation with their father again and became pregnant and um
Participant: it just was not a good time
Participant: and he pretty much you know was not comfortable with me having another child at the time
Participant: and um i wasn't comfortable
Participant: with having another child either but wanted to keep the baby but
Participant: he put me under so much stress and you know kind of i wanna say really pushed me into having terminating the the pregnancy
Participant: and that's always stayed with me and i've always missed that pregnancy that child i think about
Participant: that that baby or what could've been i try not to hold any um anger or resentment towards him or anybody about it but i know deep down inside secretly if i had it to do all over again
Participant: i would've just i would've kept the baby and moved forward so that would've been
Participant: probably the hardest especially emotionally i could deal with a lot and i have dealt with a lot you know um
Participant: being unemployed or you know lot of financial problems but that to me was the hardest
Ellie: sorry_hear (i'm sorry to hear that)
Participant: thank you
Ellie: ptsd_diagnosed (have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d)
Participant: no

Participant: um okay you know um
Participant: i was laid off in december
Participant: so i've been constantly
Participant: trying to do things to you know get um back on my feet
Participant: so that's been a little tough i've had i've had to face a lot of challenges
Participant: and dealing with that and issues with child support and trying to find another job and going back to school
Participant: so i my <m> my range of emotions have just have been just that a range and a very good friend of mine now who we both started off
Participant: you know in the same place
Participant: um about five years ago well she's been able to move forward and um go on with her life and now she's graduating
Participant: in next month from u_s_c with her master's in social work so i'm feeling a little envious of that and i have been for like the past year but more so recently
Participant: although i've very very happy for her you know and she's a good person and she deserves it but xxx of course deep down inside i wish it was me so that too has kinda been bothering me
Ellie: understand (i understand)
Participant: well
Participant: i'm really good with um people i communicate well
Participant: i like to talk i'm really good with children that's why i would like to teach or be a counselor um
Participant: although i haven't not really tapped into it i know i'm a very creative person
Participant: um
Participant: i know i write pretty good um i could possibly be a creative writer but i know i'm very creative so
Participant: if given the opportunity i know i could tap into that and really develop those skills something like with maybe songwriting um fiction writing
Participant: um
Participant: but probably like interior decorating
Participant: anything artistic just anything 'cause i love music i love the arts i love drama i love plays
Participant: um
Participant: i'm not a big fashion buff but i do love fashion and makeup and stuff like that so
Participant: um i think those would are are my strong points as well as just getting along with people i know i would make a great counselor people my friends come to me all the time i have a good ear for listening
Participant: i'm a great mediator and i know how to because i've been through a lot
Participant: and one of my friends called me the voice of reason the one that's actually graduating from s_c but um
Participant: i know i'm like light years ahead of a lot of people when it comes to insight and wisdom and i don't know if it has
Participant: to do with you know having older parents myself or how i grew up or i had i had very traditional southern parents
Participant: um who instilled a lot of great values in me or if it has anything to do with my astrological sign i'm a pisces
Participant: but um i'm i'm
Participant: really good with people just you know period
Participant: you know like i said i have my moments but i i know if it if it's something i could go into and develop i would do well
Ellie: uh_huh (uh huh)
Ellie: regret (is there anything you regret)
Participant: mm not really
Participant: some of the situations um i wish i would've waited to maybe have gotten married before i had children um picked a different partner
Participant: um
Participant: and i say that i mean my son's father is great but um
Participant: a great father for my kids but not so much as a partner for me we're not together we haven't been together in years but
Participant: i'm just saying overall i think um had i
Participant: yeah i think i would say if i could let me backtrack that say not finishing school when i should have and not following my my dreams and goals and doing things as i kinda was planning initially and
Participant: i think that's
Participant: that would i honestly be the one thing i could say i regret is not following my goals and and finishing school on time and and pursuing what i really wanted to do
Ellie: advice_back (what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago)
Participant: stay focused and finish school and pick a career path and
Participant: stay on that and stay motivated and don't let anything or anybody deter you
Ellie: mhm (mhm)
