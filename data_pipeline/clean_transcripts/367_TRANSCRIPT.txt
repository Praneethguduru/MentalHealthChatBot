Participant: it's very different um being from the east coast it just has a different feel to it um
Participant: but living
Participant: l_a is very has a very different kind of

Participant: but i've gotten more used to it since i've been here
Ellie: often_backB (how often do you go back to your hometown)

Participant: it's kind of um
Participant: i miss i miss a lot of people i miss my old life before i lost my job
Participant: um i miss um some friends um
Participant: i miss a lot of the relationships that i had out there um so it's difficult i mean it weighs on my mind a lot
Participant: um i feel like i failed
Participant: and now i'm here and i can't seem to get back on my feet so it's it's it's hard
Ellie: yeah_downer (yeah)
Ellie: shyoutgoing (do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing)
Participant: depends on the situation i think i'm outgoing when i'm comfortable
Participant: um and then i'm extremely outgoing but when i'm in a situation i'm not comfortable with i tend to be a lot more shy
Participant: so that doesn't really answer your question but
Ellie: okay_confirm (okay)
Ellie: relax_fishtank (sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax)
Participant: um [clears throat]
Participant: i have certain
Participant: i do i do a lot of writing
Participant: um i have certain
Participant: music that i listen to as i'm writing and when i can
Participant: when i can get really into that and sort of shut out the rest of the world um the music and the the thoughts just kind of
Participant: happening really um
Participant: it can it soothes me it's like it's when i feel most relaxed i guess
Ellie: mhm (mhm)
Ellie: bouts_symptoms (when was the last time that happened)
Participant: um
Participant: a few weeks ago i guess i was i'd been working on a book on a on a on a novel
Participant: and when i was really
Participant: when i was really getting into writing it and um
Participant: it was really working for me that was that was good that was really good i felt like i was accomplishing something and i felt really relaxed
Ellie: cool3 (cool)
Ellie: argument_about (what was it about)
Participant: um
Participant: it was about a
Participant: guy who is searching for
Participant: something it's
Participant: it's uh it's his last day on earth and so he's going to find a person that he
Participant: that he
Participant: met and just
Participant: was so struck by that he needs to he needs to find her and spend the last few minutes that he has on earth with her just because
Participant: sort of uh it's sort of romantic
Participant: adventure comedy kind of thing
Ellie: mm (mm)
Ellie: change_directions (what made you decide to do that)
Participant: well i've always i've always been a writer part of the reason i came to l_a was because of screenwriting
Participant: um so i wrote some screenplays and uh
Participant: you know had a little success with that out here and but since since then i've kind of gotten tired of the limitations of the screenwriting and i've started to write more short stories and and longer
Participant: just creative writing so
Participant: i i've been meaning to write a novel but i was just waiting for the idea to
Participant: to really hit me
Ellie: uh_huh (uh huh)
Ellie: difficult (how hard is that)
Participant: it's not easy the [exhale]
Participant: the parts the parts when it's good it's really good but getting there is sometimes a real struggle um
Participant: i find it difficult i have a real love hate relationship with writing when i when i love it i just absolutely love it but sometimes i
Participant: hate it because it's so difficult
Participant: um
Participant: but it's worth it for the times when it's when it's good
Ellie: yeah3 (yeah)
Ellie: see_mean (i see what you mean)
Ellie: control_temper (how are you at controlling your temper)
Participant: good i don't i don't really have a temper i
Participant: it's not i mean most of my anger that i have is directed inward as opposed to outward to other people
Participant: um if something is really really stressful or if i'm in a situation like a very intense confrontation i can
Participant: lose it but i probably <prob> that's probably only happened to me three four times in my whole life i mean generally i pretty much
Participant: try to it when i'm upset
Participant: i i get upset with myself not with other people
Ellie: last_argument (when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about)
Participant: um
Participant: last night i guess well <weh> um
Participant: i got in an argument about whether or not
Participant: cleaning vegetables was necessary because of
Participant: i forget it but it well no it was about whether you can clean vegetables after you cut them because i'd already started cutting the vegetables and i thought that would be okay
Participant: so it turned into this
Participant: big argument and we did google searches to figure out who was right and who was wrong and i
Ellie: wild_laughter5 ((laughter))
Participant: i ended up being wrong on that one but
Participant: it is
Participant: yeah that was it wasn't a blow up argument but it was a definite argument
Ellie: okay_confirm (okay)
Ellie: feelguilty (what's something you feel guilty about)
Participant: um
Participant: uh
Participant: a lot so much um
Participant: uh
Participant: i
Participant: i
Participant: i was in uh a relationship that i really really
Participant: um
Participant: that i really wanted to work
Participant: and
Participant: uh
Participant: i ended up and it was partly due to
Participant: i hadn't i was on i wasn't on the right medication and so i was going
Participant: at like everything sort of spiraled out of
Participant: control and i feel really guilty about the way that that ended and i mean i wasn't
Participant: i wasn't mean but i was
Participant: but i was getting more and more messed up
Participant: and i couldn't stop it and it ended and so i feel really guilty about not doing enough and and not
Participant: and and you know making her have to tell me that she never wanted to see me again
Participant: so
Participant: that was pretty that was pretty tough
Ellie: hmm_downer (hmm)
Ellie: avoid (could you have done anything to avoid it)
Participant: well some of it was was that
Participant: i wasn't medicated properly i mean now i've been to a doctor and i'm on medication that's
Participant: completely kind of i mean i still get
Participant: i still get upset and i still get depressed but it's not like it was it's not
Participant: i don't completely lose it for days at a time
Participant: um
Participant: so
Participant: i mean i know there's a part of me that knows logically that it wasn't all my fault and that if i had if i had been able to deal with the chemicals in my brain then i would've then it would've probably be different if i was who i am now then
Participant: i would've i would i would be
Participant: i would be
Participant: it probably would have gone very differently or maybe it wouldn't have but i mean i could have
Participant: i don't know i don't know if i could've done anything different
Ellie: yeah_downer (yeah)
Participant: things being how they were
Ellie: too_hard (do you think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself)
Participant: i mean it's
Participant: it's possible uh
Participant: i mean obviously
Participant: yeah because i mean that's what i do i i
Participant: take little things <thin> i mean i take little things and i just think about them all the time in my head until
Participant: until it drives me crazy i dwell on stuff
Participant: um
Participant: and it's like any little detail that comes up
Participant: i suddenly remember and it can just throw me off for a whole day i mean i still
Participant: i still get
Participant: i still get really uncomfortable and embarassed and then feel ashamed about stuff that i did in high school
Participant: which was years and years ago which i shouldn't even be thinking about anymore 'cause it's so in the past but i still get that feeling like i'm right back there
Ellie: yeah_downer (yeah)
Ellie: been_hard (that sounds really hard)
Participant: well it's it's not
Participant: easy i've been trying to figure out ways to deal with it i i mean i dealt with it for a long time by
Participant: by by drinking and and you know just trying to like slow my mind down that way
Participant: um but you know since the medication it's been better it hasn't been impossible to deal with it hasn't been easy but it's but it's been better
Ellie: Ellie17Dec2012_03 (that's good)
Ellie: symptoms_cope (how do you cope with them)
Participant: um well like i said i do a lot of
Participant: you know if i'm if i'm writing or if i'm doing anything like i kind of have to almost
Participant: be doing two things at once to occupy my brain completely
Participant: um if i'm watching t_v i have to be playing a game on my phone if i'm using i'm the computer i have to be
Participant: you know watching a t_v show or a movie on you know on in another window so that i can just
Participant: keep my mind occupied during all of that
Participant: um
Ellie: mhm (mhm)
Participant: i just need i mean
Participant: i i wish that i could just sort of let the thoughts come and deal with them but i just i can't yet
Ellie: trigger (are they triggered by something)
Participant: they're triggered by everything
Participant: pretty much anything that i that i see if i
Participant: if i
Participant: if i hear somebody with a dutch last name if i if i hear somebody talk about wisconsin if i hear you know people talk about
Participant: just
Participant: anything you know i can reach back and connect
Participant: to
Participant: to this it's really it's really
Participant: i don't know that's the thing i mean i don't ever get a break
Participant: from it
Ellie: that_sucks (that sucks)
Participant: yeah
Ellie: easy_sleep (how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep)
Participant: um
Participant: i don't know i'm a very light sleeper so i
Participant: awake and asleep and awake and asleep <asl> i have no problem going back to sleep but i generally
Participant: you know don't
Participant: i don't know i never really needed much sleep so
Participant: it's just only recently that i've really started to to like feel the effects of not getting enough sleep
Participant: like i would i would usually stay up until two or three in the morning so that i could just be so exhausted that i could just conk out and wake up the next day and feel fine go to work
Participant: um but now it's it's it's like if i do that i can't i still don't get enough sleep i don't conk out i still just sleep very lightly
Participant: you know i get up i toss and turn all night
Participant: you know and now
Participant: it's just
Participant: it's
Participant: yeah i don't sleep too great right now
Ellie: mhm (mhm)
Ellie: sleep_affects (what are you like when you don't sleep well)
Participant: um
Participant: pretty i mean
Participant: i don't know it's hard to it's hard to know i
Participant: i usually just kind of power through it and just
Participant: i'm uh i'm like how i am now just i just feel
Participant: bad
Ellie: okay_confirm (okay)
Ellie: when_diagnosed (how long ago were you diagnosed)
Participant: um
Participant: i think
Participant: about three three four years ago
Participant: um
Participant: it was when i
Participant: i had been given taking stuff for anxiety for
Participant: for
Participant: years before that but then i finally got a psychiatrist who actually sat down and talked to me and said you've actually got
Participant: this
Participant: situation and we need to get you on the medication that you're on is not working you need to get on this new medication that will actually start to like
Participant: even you out and heal you a little bit from all this so
Participant: so yeah that was that was kind of a a turning point but unfortunately
Participant: it happened after everything uh went bad so
Participant: i don't know
Ellie: describe_felt (how did you feel in that moment)
Participant: in the moment i don't know i don't really think i thought about it too much then but looking back on it i feel
Participant: it really makes me
Participant: angry it really makes me you know given where i am right now it makes me really angry that i'm
Participant: that i had to that i i lost everything because
Participant: because of
Participant: chemicals in my brain because of things that i couldn't control
Participant: and that you know the people that were supposed to help me weren't helping me i mean i was paying i was paying a lot of money to to go see doctors and they were doing and they you know it wasn't
Participant: it was it didn't help it didn't work until
Participant: until
Participant: you know i managed to find somebody who did work and i just yeah so i'm i'm like thanks guys for helping but
Participant: it was a little it's a little late now
Ellie: yeah_downer (yeah)
Ellie: why_seek_help (what got you to seek help)
Participant: um
Participant: there really wasn't any choice i had to i was i was a mess i was
Participant: it was either
Participant: i was i was self medicating it was affecting my work i mean it was everything was just at there was a point where i really realized that i mean i just had to like make this different
Participant: but again it was too late because you know then my review came up a few months later and you know after
Participant: after everything after being institutionalized once or twice and all this stuff you know they just decided that i was just not worth keeping around so they laid me off
Participant: but it was at least
Participant: that and not
Participant: firing me
Participant: but but but yeah but so i got help but it was
Participant: but it wasn't soon enough
Ellie: downer (okay)
Ellie: therapy_going (do you still go to therapy now)
Participant: uh not
Participant: not as much as i should
Participant: um
Participant: i go to a couple of
Participant: meetings
Participant: i go to i go to a_a so that i can
Participant: um you know keep control of that aspect too <t> too and there's a there's a therapy aspect to that
Participant: um unfortunately you know being unemployed
Participant: my unemployment ran out you know i'm i'm you know i'm getting my medication from the city of l_a so
Participant: you know i'm not really in a position to put money into seeing
Participant: somebody so i have a psychiatrist that i go see but it's really
Participant: very
Participant: i've i've only seen her three times in the past year so
Participant: it's basically to keep my medication coming
Ellie: okay_confirm (okay)
Participant: and then there's you <laughter>
Ellie: wild_laughter3 ((laughter))
Ellie: yeah3 (yeah)
Participant: right
Ellie: therapy_changes (what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy)
Participant: well like i said i mean
Participant: just the talk <tah> i mean the the let's just take the a_a for example because that's probably the closest <cloth> closest for that i'm seeing with therapy for now
Participant: um just saying stuff outloud is just
Participant: like getting getting this stuff out
Participant: trying to figure out how to take that mess that's in your stomach and in your brain and make it into words and sentences that make sense
Participant: that you can actually deal with
Participant: is a big step like
Participant: regardless of who
Participant: you're saying it to whether it's a therapist or just a room full of of drunks you know i mean you're you're taking all that
Participant: stuff that's that's really been killing you and you're making it into something you can deal with something that you can write down something that you can
Participant: talk about as opposed to just letting it just sit there as this formless thing
Ellie: right2 (right)
Participant: yeah
Ellie: feel_lately (how have you been feeling lately)
Participant: um
Participant: you know better than i than i have been um i mean
Participant: it it sort of
Participant: it goes <g> it has its ups and downs
Participant: um you know i'm applying for jobs
Participant: five six jobs
Participant: or more a a day you know and never getting a response never getting an interview
Participant: never even getting close to
Participant: to to being self sufficient again
Participant: um
Participant: it's hard but that's like real world problems i feel like the chemical parts are getting under control like the the depression is getting under control
Participant: so now it's just i have to deal with real life which is
Participant: it just has its it's just its own own challenge
Ellie: yeah3 (yeah)
Ellie: good_job (it can be tough to find a good job these days)
Participant: yeah
Ellie: happy_lasttime (tell me about the last time you felt really happy)
Participant: um
Participant: it was probably you know a couple years ago
Participant: um
Participant: i i was
Participant: i mean the thing that immediately comes to mind
Participant: uh
Participant: is
Participant: everything was going well at my job i was making these great videos with with this person that i that iwas having a relationship with and we were really close
Participant: we were having fun together
Participant: and we went out and got a christmas tree
Participant: and
Participant: we spent the all this time picking out the perfect christmas tree and it was just
Participant: feeling like a part of somebody's life
Participant: and feeling like a part of the bigger
Participant: the bigger life
Participant: that's that's out there you know like what normal people feel
Participant: you know for that instant i felt like
Participant: a normal person doing a normal thing with a pretty girl who he really really liked a lot and
Participant: you know everything was going really well and
Participant: i mean it wasn't going really well because it was all messed up but for that instant i felt like a normal person
Participant: a normal happy person
Participant: and
Participant: part of what makes it so hard now is knowing that
Participant: i don't know if i'll ever feel that again
Participant: so
Ellie: uh_huh (uh huh)
