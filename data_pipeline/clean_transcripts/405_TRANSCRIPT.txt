Ellie: hard_decisionB (tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make)
Participant: um <sigh> let's see oh my god
Participant: hardest decision
Participant: i guess leaving my first husband that was pretty hard
Ellie: tell_about_that (can you tell me about that)
Participant: um well you know we were married and i wasn't
Participant: content i guess you could say
Participant: um and
Participant: i kinda just
Participant: gave up on our relationship and
Participant: i i now that i look back i think it's because
Participant: i wanted
Participant: children and he would've been happy to never have any
Participant: and so uh since i didn't have a father
Participant: it was very important
Participant: that i
Participant: create children with someone who really wanted to be a father
Participant: and so i was kind of
Participant: at a age where i needed to start thinking about
Participant: having children
Participant: yet i was with someone who really was not into it so that
Participant: i think that's one uh maybe the core reason why i was not content and i just
Participant: felt like
Participant: <tisk> this marriage isn't gonna work and
Participant: so you know we went to therapy and everything and he did not wanna break up and
Participant: <tisk> um
Participant: <tisk> and i had to leave him
Participant: because i just wasn't happy and that was that was very  hard 'cause
Participant: you know
Participant: i felt like i was hurting him  which which i was you know and he survived he got over it now he's  married with two kids <laughter>
Participant: <laughter> but um
Participant: it was
Participant: hard
Participant: to leave him
Ellie: yeah_downer (yeah)
Ellie: memory_erase (tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory)
Participant: mm
Participant: something i wish i could erase from my memory
Participant: i have to think about that
Participant: i'm sure there's something <gasp> oh well
Participant: yeah there's um
Participant: i guess it'd be nice to erase
Participant: from my memory  um a recent i mean not recent but an event
Participant: in my
Participant: recent adulthood here in culver city
Participant: where one of my best friends
Participant: um
Participant: i've betrayed me by
Participant: back years ago when my husband first got into real estate
Participant: she and her family were growing and they really needed  a larger home
Participant: and
Participant: um
Participant: we just assumed that you know that they would use
Participant: my husband as their agent both to sell their current home current at the time
Participant: and purchase a new home
Participant: <tisk> and as it turned out
Participant: they surprised us and
Participant: had been talking to this other local agent
Participant: and uh yeah
Participant: that was devastating
Participant: i don't think i had ever  been betrayed
Participant: like that
Participant: so i wish i could  erase that now 'cause now you know this was back when the kids were really young
Participant: and um
Participant: my daughter at the time my youngest daughter was let's say
Participant: six maybe
Participant: um
Participant: maybe five
Participant: anyway her <h>
Participant: her and my best friend's
Participant: daughter are the same age they were born within days of each other
Participant: we were pregnant together
Participant: and um
Participant: they were really tight those two little girls and they ended up not going to the same elementary school  so they didn't get to hang out during those years but every time we'd run into them in the neighborhood or they'd
Participant: run into each other at a summer camp or something they were just so connected they were
Participant: just you know like two peas in a pod even though it's her
Participant: their moms weren't talking to each other anymore
Participant: so now they're thirteen and fourteen and they're in middle school together
Participant: and they're still very connected in fact <laughter>
Participant: she she for the first time spent the night at our house last night with my daughter
Participant: and another girl
Participant: and it's just a little awkward you know 'cause now
Participant: these girls are
Participant: becoming really good friends better friends
Participant: um
Participant: and yet
Participant: i still have this
Participant: vivid
Participant: um
Participant: bad memory
Participant: of what her
Participant: her mom did to
Participant: to me
Ellie: yeah_downer (yeah)
Participant: that was about what
Participant: ten
Participant: about eight years ago
Participant: anyway
Participant: <sigh> i tried to i tried to
Ellie: im_sorry (i'm sorry)
Participant: ignore it and put it out of my head and
Participant: which i've been able to <sniff>
Participant: in recent years
Participant: but obviously it still comes up
Ellie: yeah_downer (yeah)
Participant: anyway that that was that
Ellie: easy_sleep (how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep)
Participant: <sniff>
Participant: um not that easy
Participant: i do sometimes get a decent night's sleep but
Participant: sometimes it's hard to get to sleep and most of the time i wake up
Participant: and can't get back to sleep
Participant: uh or i finally get back to sleep and then it's almost time to get up you know that
Participant: that difficult thing
Ellie: trigger (are they triggered by something)
Participant: well the waking up in the middle of the night is definitely triggered by having to go to the bathroom <laughter>
Participant: and then um
Participant: <tisk> you know it's not always that easy to get back to sleep and then i wake up again to go to the bathroom
Participant: so i guess that's the trigger
Participant: as far as getting to sleep having a hard time there
Participant: i don't know i think there's just too much on my mind
Participant: running through my mind and the day
Participant: i feel like i haven't accomplished enough during the day so
Participant: it's hard for me to just go to sleep when i'm supposed to
Participant: i guess
Ellie: downer (okay)
Ellie: sleep_affects (what are you like when you don't sleep well)
Participant: um
Participant: well i'm kinda used to it now
Participant: so i just go on
Participant: through the day probably looking <laughter> looking tired and um
Participant: i i'm kinda used to feeling tired i just do what i need to do
Participant: and sometimes if i'm able to if i'm at home and don't have
Participant: huge commitments yeah i might just like i said earlier just take a nap or something
Participant: read my book watch t_v watch whatever
Ellie: mhm (mhm)
Ellie: feel_lately (how have you been feeling lately)

Participant: upset about <laughter> coincidentally that was another breakup i had to make back then
Participant: i was um
Participant: <tisk> in my early twenties and i needed to break up with my boyfriend but again it was very upsetting 'cause i
Participant: you know it was hard because he didn't wanna break up and i felt like i was hurting him
Participant: and i didn't understand this feeling
Participant: i was really upset
Participant: how i didn't that was my first time having depression so i didn't really
Participant: recognize <r> recognize it as depression but i went somehow i
Participant: had the
Participant: knowledge or the
Participant: i was able to
Participant: take myself to a psychiatrist i remember i paid for her by the hour
Participant: and she prescribed xanax to just help relax me
Participant: and so i guess that helped me get through that and then i've had depression throughout the years just you know little bits here and there for various reasons such as

Participant: stay in college get my degree
Participant: um
Participant: get therapy try to become a happy
Participant: um
Participant: yeah try to figure out things earlier in life
Participant: like
Participant: yeah
Participant: stay in college and oh and mainly i think the main you know what it all boils down to <laughter> no matter what you're depressed about it seems like
Participant: as as the saying goes and the songs <s> the
Participant: songs go you know
Participant: it's all about money the world revolves around money and
Participant: having none
Participant: that in itself is very depressing <laughter> so besides relationships and different things  that have happened in your life
Participant: having no money
Participant: is
Participant: you know it's like you can't even try to fix anything because you don't have the money to fix it
Participant: so
Participant: with that in mind i would uh definitely advise myself to get my college degree
Participant: and to stick <s> get a job and stick with it
Participant: um
Participant: don't quit
Participant: to go traveling you know
Participant: just stick with a job stick with a company build up your
Participant: seniority keep your benefits
Participant: and build up some knowledge or some expertise in some sort of field
Participant: yeah that would've been
Participant: my biggest piece of advice to myself
Ellie: okay_confirm (okay)
