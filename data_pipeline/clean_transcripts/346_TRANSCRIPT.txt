Ellie: are they triggered by something
Participant: um
Participant: i dream a lot about um the stuff that has uh
Participant: has affected me throughout the years so um
Participant: it's usually you know like i i'll dream about something that stressed me out and then i'll wake up and my my chest'll hurt
Participant: um
Participant: or just i just can't sleep all night because i just think i seem to be i don't know if i'm afraid to go to sleep
Participant: but i uh <sigh>
Participant: i just i don't know i feel like that <th> that's a vulnerable place for me
Participant: because of stuff that've happened to me
Ellie: yeah
Participant: so um
Participant: i i so i sleeping is just not really something i do well
Ellie: okay
Ellie: what are you like when you don't sleep well

Participant: um
Participant: i uh i'm just negative <ne> a negative person
Participant: um which really that's not me um
Participant: i uh yeah i'm like <l> judgmental is not me either um i just
Participant: i'm just not a not a nice person to be around
Ellie: how do you cope with them
Participant: um
Participant: i try to <t> i i spend a lot of my time reading i try to go out and do um i force myself to go out and do things um
Participant: just to keep myself involved
Participant: um so that i don't uh sit <si> just sit around and and and dwell on the fact that i can't sleep and i i try to um get myself as exhausted as i possibly can
Participant: um by running around and and and doing things
Participant: so
Ellie: mhm
Ellie: how hard is that
Participant: um it's difficult
Participant: um i do like there is a part of me that doesn't wanna
Participant: i don't really wanna go out and do things i have to actually force myself to um if i have make appointments i uh
Participant: i make appointments to like for auditions or or um
Participant: even to do this i um i i tend to uh
Participant: just not
Participant: like at the last minute i'll i'll try to convince myself not to go <laughter> but then i force myself to anyways
Ellie: yeah
Ellie: i see
Ellie: have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d
Participant: yes
Ellie: how long ago were you diagnosed
Participant: um i've been diagnosed for two instances
Participant: um i was diagnosed <dia> diagnosed about three years three and a half years ago
Participant: and then i was diagnosed again um in august
Ellie: what got you to seek help
Participant: um
Participant: the first time it was um
Participant: i just wasn't sleeping <sl> because of the not sleeping um
Participant: and the uh just the stress <st> the unbelievable stress
Ellie: uh huh
Participant: um
Participant: and then the second time it was a xxx uh once again i started with the not sleeping um and then every moment of the day was just thinking about what happened to me um
Participant: and i just i i just couldn't take it anymore
Participant: so i i figured um
Participant: i was getting too gloomy i was getting like um
Participant: not thinking life was worth it and and i i i that's i just needed to see somebody before anything escalated
Ellie: yeah
Ellie: that sounds really hard
Participant: yeah
Participant: it was
Ellie: do you still go to therapy now
Participant: i no <n> do not
Ellie: why did you stop
Participant: um one of the reasons i went to new york was to try to um
Participant: get out of my environment
Participant: um
Participant: and uh
Participant: and that seemed to help a lot
Participant: um
Ellie: uh huh
Participant: and uh out here i i was i just the counselors that i was going to just didn't really seem to be helping me much
Participant: um they just
Ellie: i'm sorry to hear that
Participant: they just seemed to be giving me a lot of medications and i don't believe that that's what i needed
Participant: um
Ellie: yeah
Participant: yeah so um
Participant: yeah
Ellie: how have you been feeling lately
Participant: <sigh> stressed um uh lately i've been really sad and i don't know why
Participant: um
Participant: but like i said i've been trying to combat that by um
Participant: keeping myself busy
Ellie: that's good
Ellie: when was the last time you felt really happy
Participant: um
Participant: actually um
Participant: i'm kind of
Participant: a couple days ago
Participant: i was actually really happy and i was genuinely happy
Participant: um but then i went back to
Participant: being you know going back to feeling miserable
Participant: so
Ellie: can you tell me about that
Participant: um
Participant: well i realized
Participant: i got up in the morning i actually did get a good night of sleep
Participant: and um
Participant: i realized uh that i'm actually really lucky
Participant: um 'cause i've been through a lot in my life and i have um somebody in my life who really loves me and somebody who um is finally there for me
Participant: and uh
Participant: you know he gives me what i need emotionally and i was just really thankful for that
Participant: and that made me really happy
Participant: um
Ellie: that's so good to hear
Participant: yeah
Participant: thank you <laughter>
Ellie: what are you most proud of in your life
Participant: oh geez
Participant: um
Participant: i've had so many years of just
Participant: just bad just a lot of bad
Participant: that it there has it's been a long time
Participant: since i've been proud of anything
Participant: i guess if anything it's my ability to survive through all the hardships i've been through
Ellie: mhm
Participant: um my <m> a lesser person i guess would've
Participant: gotten rid of themselves a long time ago
Participant: but um even though like i'm really depressed and i feel gloomy and i feel <fe> just feel miserable about a lot of things um
Participant: there's gotta be a silver lining
Participant: so
Ellie: yeah
Participant: um so yeah so i mean like i guess that's what i'm proud of that uh
Participant: i although a whole bunch of bad things have happened to me it hasn't ruined me i still try to be a good person um i i try not to be negative towards other people
Participant: and um
Participant: and truthful and i still i still have drive in me
Ellie: that's great
Participant: yeah
Ellie: is there anything you regret
Participant: ugh <sigh> so much um
Participant: my last marriage
Participant: um not getting out when i should have
Participant: um
Participant: and uh just
Participant: i regret a lot
Ellie: what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago
Participant: <sigh>
Participant: um the any situation that would've had a red flag um
Participant: eh just get out of it you know eh some things just don't work
Participant: and um
Participant: no matter how hard you try no matter how much you put into it so um
Participant: i i would tell myself um to um
Participant: that it's not selfish
Participant: to let go of a bad situation
Participant: and um not everybody can be helped so sometimes you just gotta live for yourself and help yourself
Ellie: yeah
Participant: so if
Ellie: mhm
Participant: had i known that then had had i known that
Participant: then i i i probably would've done better in life
Participant: so
Ellie: i see what you mean
Participant: yeah
Ellie: what are some things that make you really mad
Participant: <sigh>
Participant: um
Participant: people who um
Participant: when people are down on me for my faults
Participant: um that i have done that i have things that i've done in my past that people steal still relive when i'm trying to forgive myself um
Participant: people who are mean to other people uh people who talk poorly about people behind their backs people that are untrustworthy
Participant: um
Participant: just anybody who picks on the little guy
Participant: um
Participant: you know people who don't care about the environment or animals
Participant: um
Ellie: mhm
Participant: i just <jus> i think that everybody should be as good as they possibly can be
Participant: and uh it's it's disheartening and it it just makes me so mad that people just can't be people don't let people live people try to make um everybody feel as negative and as poorly as they do
Participant: and uh i that makes me mad
Ellie: yeah
Ellie: okay
Ellie: what do you do when you're annoyed
Participant: <laughter> i vent <laughter> um
Participant: yeah i tend to vent and then uh
Participant: and them um and then it's usually over i try not to bad mouth people um
Participant: i try to just talk through it until um until it's gone and then it doesn't bother me anymore
Ellie: that's good
Ellie: how are you at controlling your temper
Participant: mm
Participant: i try not to get angry um
Participant: because i have a really bad temper
Participant: and it um
Participant: and it can get outta hand so um
Participant: what i do is i i <laughter> something gets me so mad i tend to go and take a nap
Participant: um <laughter> if i'm not in that situation where i can just go and take a nap um i usually just walk away from the situation and i try to clear my mind
Participant: and come back to it
